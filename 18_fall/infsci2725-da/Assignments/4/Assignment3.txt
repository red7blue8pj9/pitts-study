Assignment 3: Validation and Testing

File house-votes-84.txt (attached) contains 435 records of United
States representatives.  Each record shows how the representative
voted on each of 16 different issues (columns in the file).
The following three files:

  House Votes Manual.xdsl
  House Votes Naive.xdsl
  House Votes PC.xdsl

contain GeNIe models that can be used as classification tools:
Based on the voting records the models guess the party affiliation
of the representative (there are only two parties represented in
the United States Congress: Democratic and Republican).

Your task is to test the three models (using GeNIe will be the
easiest) and report for each of them:

(1) Overall classification accuracy
(2) Sensitivity and specificity for each of the two parties
(3) Positive and negative predictive value for each of the two parties
(4) Calibration curve for a selected bin count or window size

Please use the "leave-one-out" cross-validation method in your tests.
