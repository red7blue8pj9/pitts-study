Here is a quick look at the three finalists and the types of restaurants they have in mind. KWAME ONWUACHI, 24Raised in the Bronx. When he was a teenager, his mother sent him on a two-year visit to his grandfather in Nigeria, worried that he didn’t appreciate the upsides of life in the United States. Later dropped out of college to cook on a boat. Ends Dinner Lab meals with his take on a Butterfinger candy bar.Restaurant idea: Food that is “approachable yet refined,” served in a room with black banquettes and porcelain tiles, and “paintings from the ’80s that add color.” AARON GROSSKOPF, 36Grew up in the Napa Valley of California. While in high school, began cooking at Kinyon Cafe in Yountville. Would later apprentice in Lyon, France, under the chef Pierre Orsi and work at Per Se in Manhattan.Restaurant idea: A modern take on a bistro with “American cuisine, with California ingredients and French techniques.” He’d call it Espelette. DANIEL ESPINOZA, 24Raised in Chicago. Started cooking at 15, when the cook at a tiny dive where he bussed tables didn’t show up to work. Traveled the world and eventually landed at Mexique, a Mexican-French fusion restaurant in Chicago. Ends his Dinner Lab meals with piñatas, which are broken open by guests.Restaurant idea:  A place where “I can proudly say, ‘These are my roots as a Mexican and I am feeding it to you subliminally.’ ”Advertisement
