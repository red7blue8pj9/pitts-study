But lost in the furor has been the fact that Project Runway, the fashion reality TV show, snagged four Emmy nominations — outstanding reality competition program, outstanding host for a reality or reality competition program, outstanding cinematography for reality programming and outstanding picture editing for reality programming — more than ever before.To celebrate, Heidi Klum posted a video of herself and her co-host, Tim Gunn, jumping for joy. It’s pretty cute.And it’s also understandable. After all, it has been 11 years since “Project Runway” debuted. In the years since, it’s won two Emmys and been nominated 38 times — at least once a year since it began.That’s pretty impressive, and it speaks to the evolution of fashion into a pop culture phenomenon. I’m not a huge fan of the program — I think it creates a distorted perception of what it takes to succeed in fashion that is not productive — but I also think it’s impossible to ignore the transformative effect it has had on fashion’s profile in the general population (not to mention the profile of designer hosts such as Michael Kors and his replacement, Zac Posen) and its hold on the popular imagination.In any case, come Sept. 20 — just after New York Fashion Week — we’ll find out if it won. Stay tuned.Advertisement
