Justice Dept. Backs Suit Accusing Facebook of Violating Fair Housing Act - The New York Times

On Tuesday, it formally filed a complaint against the company.Facebook said on Friday that it has worked to prevent such misuse.“Over the past year, we’ve strengthened our systems to further protect against misuse,” said Andy Stone, a spokesman for the company. “We’re aware of the statement of interest filed and will respond in court; and we’ll continue working directly with HUD to address their concerns.”Facebook continues to face sharp questions over its business model, which helps advertisers, interest groups and others to tailor messages to the site’s more than two billion users worldwide.The approach, called microtargeting, has helped Facebook become one of the world’s most lucrative and powerful companies. But now that strategy is under scrutiny as government officials in the United States and Europe warn that it can be used to manipulate voters by inflaming ideological divides and weaponizing information.Federal prosecutors have said that Russians used Facebook to influence voters in the run-up to the 2016 election and to deepen political discord.The company also allowed the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica to harvest user data, a move that may have given President Trump an edge in the election.Last month, Facebook said it had identified a new political influence campaign on its platform that was potentially intended to disrupt this year’s midterm elections.Follow Katie Benner on Twitter: @ktbenner.Get politics and Washington news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the Morning Briefing newsletter.Advertisement
