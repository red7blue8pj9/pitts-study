AdvertisementHave you found yourself in the middle of a heated political discussion, wondering, “How could someone possibly think that?” These days, the answer is almost certainly yes. Our political discourse is increasingly polarized and vicious. Many people understandably fear that they are trapped in a bubble, hearing from and talking to only those people who already agree with them. Even more so, Americans fear that the other side of the political spectrum is trapped in an even more damaging bubble.The truth is, our society cannot function well if we refuse to engage with people who have different views. Democracy depends on respectful disagreement — even when it’s fundamental and intense disagreement.“The Argument,” a new Opinion podcast from The New York Times, embraces that idea of respectful disagreement. Its hosts — Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt — hold strongly different beliefs, but they also respect one another and they enjoy talking together about the biggest issues facing the country.Starting Thursday, Oct. 11, join Ross, Michelle and David, along with special guests, as they debate topics from across the political spectrum. You’ll learn how the opposing side thinks and discover new ways to sharpen your own arguments.Subscribe now for a sneak peek and to receive our first episode when it publishes on Thursday, Oct. 11. You can find “The Argument” on iTunes, Google Play, Spotify, Stitcher or wherever you listen to podcasts.Advertisement
