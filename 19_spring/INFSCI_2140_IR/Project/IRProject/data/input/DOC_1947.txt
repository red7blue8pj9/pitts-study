So it’s not as if the most popular Camino de Santiago, the 500-mile Camino Francés, which starts at St.-Jean-Pied-de-Port in the Pyrenees, needs any publicity. Still, “The Way,” Emilio Estevez’s 2011 film about four modern-day hikers — one played by his father, Martin Sheen — introduced many to the trek and its meditative pleasures.“Walking the Camino: Six Ways to Santiago” could increase the foot traffic. This documentary by Lydia B. Smith follows six travelers as they make the trip in 30 days or so. Some have come to test themselves; others for true spiritual exploration; one because she has reached a personal impasse and doesn’t know what to do next.The trail, of course, is absurdly photogenic. Sunbeams stream through clouds; valleys are viewed from mountaintops; morning mists hug meadows. The film also catalogs the challenges: blisters, aching joints, the snoring in hostels, the lack of hygiene. Sometimes the sun is too hot, the wind too strong, the rain too soaking. A pilgrimage is not supposed to be comfortable. Over time, Camino becomes a noun, verb and state of mind. As weights are shed — from both the pack and the soul — everyone is somehow changed. Religious quest or not, one priest says, “the Camino is pure medicine.”As travelogue, this is a persuasive introduction. Viewer beware: The impulse to take a hike is strong.
