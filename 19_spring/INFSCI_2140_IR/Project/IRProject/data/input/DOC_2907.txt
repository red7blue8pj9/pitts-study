The Vatican didn’t immediately provide a transcript of his remarks, but the ANSA news agency quoted him as denouncing the prenatal tests that can result in parents choosing to terminate a pregnancy if the fetus is malformed or suffering other problems.“Last century, the whole world was scandalized by what the Nazis did to purify the race. Today, we do the same thing but with white gloves,” the agency quoted Francis as saying.The pope urged families to accept children “as God gives them to us.”Francis has repeated the strict anti-abortion stance of his predecessors and integrated it into his broader condemnation of what he calls today’s “throwaway culture.” He has frequently lamented how the sick, the poor, the elderly and the unborn are considered unworthy of protection and dignity by a society that prizes individual prowess.He said women are often considered part of this throwaway culture and are forced to prostitute themselves.“How many of you pray for these women who are thrown away, for these women who are used, for these girls who have to sell their own dignity to have a job?” Francis asked during his morning homily Friday.Francis has dedicated much of his pontificate to preaching about families, marriage and the problems that families today encounter. He is expected to highlight the issues during a trip in August to Ireland, which recently voted to legalize abortion.Advertisement
