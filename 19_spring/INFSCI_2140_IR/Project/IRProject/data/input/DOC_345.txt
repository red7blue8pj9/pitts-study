Great PerformersThe Times critics Wesley Morris and A.O. Scott discuss how the year’s best acting showed us two kinds of power: One found in professional experience, the other in the experience of being alive.Ashton Sanders of “Moonlight”CreditCreditJack Davison for The New York TimesSupported byBy Wesley Morris and A.O. ScottWESLEY MORRIS: What is it about watching someone become someone else that has been so mesmerizing for so many people for so long? What is it about a person’s becoming his or her ultimate self that we can’t resist? It’s all-powerful, all-consuming stuff. In life, that consumption can be dangerous. But in art, I want my mind controlled by that power. I want an actor’s skill, intelligence, energy, body and face to overtake me. I love the movie magic of no longer seeing an actor — or especially a star — but a person.A.O. SCOTT: Me, too. And the best place to surrender to the power you describe is still in a darkened theater, in spite of all the competing performances we can sample on television and elsewhere. The movies still feel larger than life and blissfully distant from it, even as life grows crazier and more improbable than the movies. But the big screen hardly holds a monopoly. Let’s be honest: If we weren’t limited to movie stars here, we might have come up with a list of great performers that included Beyoncé, Donald Trump, LeBron James and whoever we suppose Elena Ferrante to be.But what’s most fascinating to me about movies now is how many different kinds of acting coexist within the art form. In these pages, we have some people who excel through the discipline of old-fashioned theatrical technique and others who seem less like actors than like unwitting documentary subjects. I marvel at the deep craft that Denzel Washington and Viola Davis wield in bringing to life characters invented by August Wilson (in “Fences”). I also marvel at the apparent artlessness of Krisha Fairchild (in “Krisha”) and Sasha Lane (in “American Honey”), who don’t seem to be pretending at all. Washington and Davis, playing a long-married couple living in Pittsburgh in the 1950s, feel like recognizable American archetypes; the characters, at least at first, are as familiar as the people playing them. Krisha (the character) is a middle-aged woman with a history of substance abuse and awful behavior who pays a Thanksgiving visit to her semi-estranged family. Fairchild (the performer) seems so much like that person that you wonder if she might show up at your next holiday meal. Similarly, you can’t be entirely sure that Sasha Lane won’t ring your doorbell selling dubious magazine subscriptions. Each performer pursues, and achieves, a distinct kind of credibility.MORRIS: Yes, this group of men and women presents a gamut of what movie acting can be and do: knock you out, break your heart, scare you, delight you, amuse and haunt you, whether through vertiginously high style (hey there, Denzel and Viola) or plain-old naturalism. Sometimes the feat is intangible, like the way that Ruth Negga’s eyes and frown, as she plays Mildred Loving in “Loving” — Jeff Nichols’s film about the landmark interracial-marriage case — offer deep reserves of sadness. If Modigliani ever painted the Delta blues, it would look something Negga’s expression in this movie. She doesn’t have much to do in “Loving,” and part of me wishes she were able to get up to more. But here’s a woman who can calibrate a long face so that it has a gravitational pull. And that’s really something.Negga works in the naturalist style you identified in Sasha Lane and Krisha Fairchild. But it’s funny: I hadn’t thought of Fairchild as practicing naturalism until just now. Fairchild has an arresting beauty — it’s crystal-shop Sharon Stone — and a flair for tragedy that reminds me of Cassavetes-era Gena Rowlands. But part of what makes her so good is the simple surprise of her talent: We had never seen this woman before. In the opening scene, the minute she gets out of that car, takes a few steps and then trudges back to get the suitcase she forgot, I knew I was in for something other than — or in addition to — realism. I knew I was watching a woman wielding a control over her rawness. Her commitment becomes the drama. We’re so absorbed in this woman’s state of mind that the simple dressing of a turkey becomes Hitchcock-suspenseful.SCOTT: And one of the most hackneyed conceits in all of movies — the family holiday from hell — becomes the freshest, scariest, most electrifying domestic nightmare anyone has ever shot.MORRIS: How can someone this good have gone unnoticed for this long? There are lots of fresh faces in our group, and some of what makes, say, Royalty Hightower, who is 11, so different from a legend like Isabelle Huppert is that walking into “The Fits,” I really didn’t know where that little girl with the intoxicating studiousness was going to take me. I just knew I’d follow her wherever that turned out to be. We talked at some point about what unites the actors gathered for this issue, and I really do think, whether it’s Hightower or someone we see all the time, like Washington or Huppert, it’s surprise, don’t you?SCOTT: Yes, we’re used to seeing the same thing repeated everywhere — not only in the entertainment we consume but also in our interactions with the real world. Most of us, most of the time, are content to rest on our assumptions about what other people are like. Online, we traffic in algorithms, aggregations and demographic data sets, the pseudoscientific dressing for old habits of generalization and stereotyping. But a strong performance can smash through that complacency with a force akin to love or friendship, reminding us that the odd, the idiosyncratic, the irreducibly individual still have a place in our standardized and quantified world. We quickly discover that we’ve never seen anyone like this before.What astonishes me is how many different forms this uniqueness can take, how many distinct techniques there are for arriving at it. Troy Maxson, Denzel Washington’s character in “Fences,” sails onto the screen on gusts of verbiage. He probably utters more words in the first two minutes of that movie than all three of the actors who play Chiron do in the entirety of “Moonlight.” But the character, born in August Wilson’s words, takes life in Washington’s body. Troy’s history — a brutal childhood, a spell in prison, a baseball career and a lot of sex, liquor and manual labor in the midst of it all — is all written in Washington’s posture. Shoulders back, belly forward, all the weight centered in the hips, a kinetic vision of masculine grace and power worn down and gone slightly to seed.What happens in “Moonlight” is something else altogether. It tells what might have been a standard coming-of-age story, about a young man growing up poor, black and queer in the Liberty City section of Miami. But instead of the usual plot points, the story is fashioned out of moods and emotions, by the flickerings of Chiron’s consciousness and the stirrings of his desire. It’s a three-dimensional portrait in color and sound, and Alex Hibbert, Ashton Sanders and Trevante Rhodes — who play Chiron as a schoolboy, a teenager and a grown man — execute a coup de cinéma that feels to me utterly without precedent. A single soul occupies three distinct bodies.MORRIS: In American movies, children have often been asked to be hams, to weaponize cuteness and spunk. But you get tired of kiddie kleptomaniacs. You want to see some risks. Now the old European style of acting has happily come into American independent filmmaking: lots of stillness and quiet, these moments of privacy, solitude and thinking, from actors who, to us, are strangers — and often uncannily seasoned young people. Sometimes all that quiet and stillness comes off as bashful, as amateurism. But often, as in “Moonlight,” it’s simply confidence re-engineered. Each of the three chapters in Chiron’s life is handled by a different actor. Plenty of films use flashbacks or prologues featuring a younger version of the protagonist to telescope an adult hero’s journey, and it can be a hokey device for any number of reasons, including misbegotten casting. The coup you identify in “Moonlight” has precisely to do with the brilliance of its casting, and for us, that starts with Hibbert, who plays the youngest Chiron with top-secret assurance. Some actors really are hams. This kid was born with the discipline of a vegetarian.Hibbert’s a peanut who can sit at a dining-room table or stand in a long shot of an open field and draw you to him. He’s got a serene, self-protectively hardened face that conveys simultaneous hurt and wonder and an awareness that the wonder can hurt. All of that complexity is in the baton that’s passed to Sanders, a very different performer with a very different face, but he amplifies what Hibbert gives him and adds physicality, volatility and grace. Sanders has two scenes that involve walking, and the way he uses each gait to evoke a distinctly different mood of dismay killed me. The director, Barry Jenkins, uses two performances to establish these feelings and experiences, then hands them off to Rhodes, whose final incarnation of Chiron strategically buries all that has preceded him in rock-hard thuggery. I think he has the hardest job. First, you try following Hibbert and Sanders! Second, he has to perform a hardness that we know is an act — he’s got to exude some of Hibbert and Sanders’s innocence. Third, he has to nail a crucial phone call for the movie’s psychological junction to make its thunderous “click.” When he takes that call, the experience of watching what’s happening on Rhodes’s face, in his being, is not unlike finding out that all Charles Foster Kane ever wanted was that sled. That’s so much of the movie right there: three performances snapping into place with one drug dealer’s dropped jaw.SCOTT: And it’s not just that — as in “Citizen Kane” — the audience is finally understanding something about the character that he already knew. Chiron at that moment is finally understanding himself, and we are witnesses to the unlocking of his inner secret.MORRIS: A few of these performances rely on a moment or two to unlock what best illustrates a character’s character. I’m thinking about Casey Affleck, Viola Davis and Taraji P. Henson. The beauty of what they’ve done with their roles has everything to do with patience — remembering that you’re playing much more than a single, crucial moment — but also to do with an understanding of how real people work, emotionally.SCOTT: Real people are often emotionally opaque to others and unavailable even to themselves. Perhaps the greatest challenge screen actors face is capturing that opacity. Nonprofessional or untrained actors sometimes have an advantage, because they haven’t been taught the tricks of controlled and sublimated expression, staples of the curriculum in those acting schools that emphasize the psychological basis of the craft. There is an enigmatic quality to the characters in Italian neorealism, early Bresson and a lot of Kiarostami that comes from the use of untrained actors.I think Sasha Lane has some of that quality. In “American Honey,” her first film, she plays a girl named Star (of course she’s named Star), who escapes a grim family situation and runs off with a feral crew of teenagers who roam the heartland selling magazine subscriptions nobody wants. They pretend to be raising money for scholarships or sports teams, but really they’re the pawns in a grim little scam, the main point of which seems to be their own exploitation. There’s a sequence in which Star breaks away from her mentor and sometime-kind-of-boyfriend (played by Shia LaBeouf) to take a ride with some middle-aged guys in cowboy hats who are out for a good time. So is Star, but it might not be the same kind of good time, and the scene unfolds with terrifying unpredictability. We don’t know what’s going to happen to Star — maybe something unspeakable, maybe something uncomfortable, maybe something crazy and fun — and we also don’t know what she wants to happen, how much control she’s in or even thinks she’s in. But I don’t think Lane is playing uncertainty or ambivalence in any conventional sense. She’s not communicating her character’s recklessness; she’s matching it.MORRIS: I love that way of thinking about a certain kind of rawness. It’s a risk, right? Andrea Arnold, the director of “American Honey,” is a raw actor’s director. She knows what to do with roughness and edginess and daring. She’s searching for that in her casting. When it works, it’s spellbinding for the audience. Harvey Keitel in any of his primes had it. So have Jennifer Jason Leigh and Angela Bassett in theirs. Joaquin Phoenix is my current favorite in this style of post-Marlon Brando performance. Part of it is: How far in, out, up, down will this actor go? Will he or she get to a place where all the training and technique are gone and you’re just watching an arsonist play with matches? Guys like Nicolas Cage or Ed Harris or Tom Hardy can go too far with the fire and sometimes seem to act just to burn everything down.SCOTT: In the anti-Method acting manifesto “True and False,” David Mamet argues that what we respond to in a great performance is not the dubious “emotional truth” of the character but rather the existential courage of the actor. This is something more clearly seen onstage, where there is no chance to retake or fix it in postproduction and where the audience is always at least somewhat conscious of watching “a real body in real time.” But the camera also forces risks on those who step in front of it. When I reflect on the moments in recent movies that have stayed with me — Taraji P. Henson arriving in her NASA office, soaking wet, to claim the respect that is her due; Casey Affleck walking away from Michelle Williams on a frigid New England street; Sasha Lane plunging into a Texas swimming pool; Don Cheadle as Miles Davis suffering the indignity of a visit to a Columbia University dormitory in the midst of an absurd caper — I think that the right name for what I’ve witnessed is bravery.MORRIS: Ah, that word! Bravery. It’s so easily overused and misapplied. Bravery and fearlessness should be in the actor’s job description: to risk exposure, vulnerability, failure in an attempt to achieve what our Method-trained friends would call “truth” and David Mamet might call “what I command.” But obviously, bravery in screen acting exists. Any woman who takes an assignment with Lars von Trier, for example — Emily Watson, Björk, Nicole Kidman, Bryce Dallas Howard, Kirsten Dunst and especially Charlotte Gainsbourg — embodies the concept to a degree that abuts holiness and would alarm H.R.Right now, given how few screen actors are expected — or hired — to achieve anything close, it’s a trait that feels increasingly endangered. But what is it? A result of a seemingly hazardous workplace? The choice to forgo likability in favor of being fully human? A willingness to push yourself, regardless of the outcome, to some new expressive frontier? Sasha Lane exceeds these definitions — while working with Shia LaBeouf, too, a terribly underrated performer whose self-regard is crying out for a director to toss him a book of Nicolas Cage’s matches. I actually think the scene in which Taraji P. Henson explodes at her co-workers in “Hidden Figures” is more brave of the character — Katherine Johnson, a black female mathematician working among scores of white men in the early 1960s — than of the woman playing her. That’s a moment of cathartic acting, of roaring release. She delivers that speech the way a battleship delivers a torpedo. And accordingly, it does blow a hole in the rest of a smartly done, crowd-pleasing movie, because you don’t forget that in addition to the space race, there’s this other race thing going on. But what I found brave about the rest of her performance is how demure she has allowed herself to be. Katherine seems as surprised by her outburst as we and those men are. Until then, she’s playing everything but anger.SCOTT: There is an element of self-awareness, just this side of winking, in the way Henson holds herself in check. At the moment, she is known to all the sentient television-watching world as Cookie Lyon, a volcano of rage, greed, maternal possessiveness and sexual need. One fantasy that “Hidden Figures” invites is that the nerdy, demure, slightly disheveled Katherine will respond to the slights and insults thrown her way by Kirsten Dunst’s character and the rest of the white power structure by unleashing her inner Cookie. Of course the stereotypical view of black womanhood embedded in that fantasy is part of what “Hidden Figures” is attacking, and Henson is central to that attack. Her self-control mirrors Katherine’s self-control, but Henson is also letting us know that she has always been in control. I would call that assertion a form of bravery.MORRIS: Truly brave, of course, is all some actors ever do. That’s all Isabelle Huppert ever does. And you’d think it would get old watching her go out on yet another limb. But Huppert is why I’ll never stop going to the movies: She’s all limbs. In “Elle,” she plays a clammy video-game executive who is haunted by a sexual assault. The appalling audacity of the movie, which Paul Verhoeven directed, is its refusal to draw a line between rape and fetish. But the movie is as much about Verhoeven’s toying with propriety as it is about an actress toying with herself. Her film persona is bound up in the psychodynamics of sex and power. This might be her breeziest-yet approach. And yet there are so many layers to what she’s doing here: repression, lust, shame, disgust, fun. I’ve never seen an actor so good at and so seemingly obsessed with performing instinct, subtext and offensiveness. That might get aggravating with someone else, because, ultimately, it’s meta-humanity she’s after: Even when the women she’s playing just live in Paris, they never seem entirely from Earth. But you always want to see how too-far she’ll take things.SCOTT: Even when she stays close to home, as in the finely observed domestic drama of Mia Hansen-Love’s “Things to Come,” she’s playing almost a doppelgänger of the “Elle” character — a philosophy professor whose marriage breaks up, who becomes a grandmother and whose sexual interests point in what others might regard as an inappropriate direction. She’s also kind of mean, or at least shockingly direct. But there’s no violence in Hansen-Love’s world, no sensationalism, nothing lurid. Everything in tasteful Gallic moderation, except for Huppert, who is a walking avatar of extremity. She collapses the distinction between terror and rapture.MORRIS: Huppert is among the last of a dying breed of psychological star. That kind of acting has tended to be closely associated with the Europeans and the Method people, but is it nuts to watch Kristen Stewart work and think: She could be Huppert’s daughter?SCOTT: No more nuts than my own hunch, which is that Kristen Stewart is the new Robert De Niro. Back in the ’70s and ’80s, De Niro’s reputation as the best actor in American movies rested on his ability to vanish completely into each role, to effect a physical and psychological transformation so total that you could barely recognize him from one movie to the next. Some of what he did was a matter of what you might call technical extremism: learning Sicilian dialect for “The Godfather Part II,” pushing his body from sinewy fighting trim to has-been bloatedness in “Raging Bull.” Stewart hasn’t quite done that yet, but she burrows as deeply as De Niro ever has into the interiors of her characters, arranging her expressions, her carriage, her vocal inflections — even, it can seem, her height and bone structure — accordingly.You could say that, having been made, perhaps reluctantly, into a movie star by the “Twilight” movies, she has lately reinvented herself as the character actor she might have always preferred to be. Apart from her lead performance in Olivier Assayas’s “Personal Shopper,” she has been an ensemble player in 2016, with roles in Woody Allen’s “Cafe Society,” Kelly Reichardt’s “Certain Women” and Ang Lee’s “Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk.” But the fact that she’s the most interesting person in all of those movies suggests that her movie-star charisma is still intact. She’s just using it in subtle and occasionally subversive ways.MORRIS: I think Kristen Stewart is just about the best American movie actress we have. Her bad romance with movie stardom has served her well, because early exposure to its toxins might have fortified her resistance to mere fame. Unlike with, say, Ben Affleck, there’s no tension or ambivalence between her being an actor and her being a star. She appears to have rejected the latter to insist upon the value of the former. Lots of people can have it both ways, but it’s a balance that takes a while to achieve. Look at how long it took for Meryl Streep and Leonardo DiCaprio, whose allergy to overnight godliness foreshadowed Stewart’s. In the meantime, it’s fascinating to watch her flirt with stardom in the films she takes and the women she plays.SCOTT: In “Cafe Society,” the Woody Allen movie, she takes what is, as written, an almost entirely functional character — the dream girl swooned over by both a middle-aged Hollywood mogul and his ambitious nephew; a catalyst of male desire and a mirror of masculine ego — and makes her into the only person in the film whose choices and desires really matter. In “Certain Women,” a much better movie, she slouches onto the screen with self-effacing diffidence. You may wonder if Elizabeth Travis, a young lawyer trying to earn some extra money teaching adult-ed classes to disgruntled teachers in a middle-of-nowhere Western town, is in possession of a backbone. Her posture is terrible. Her fashion sense is worse. She seems entirely capable of standing in front of a room full of people and vanishing from sight.Except to a young ranch hand (Lily Gladstone), in whose eyes Elizabeth is a dazzling, almost magical creature, the most intoxicating and glamorous person she has ever encountered — a dangerous and alluring Edward Cullen to her own humble Bella Swan. But there is no winking from Stewart herself, and none of the kind of ostentatious deglamorization that stars sometimes traffic in when they are shopping for Academy hardware. If this is realism, it’s the kind that forces you to acknowledge the gaps and blurry spaces in your previous conception of reality.Not that realism is everything. Even the drabbest, most earthbound cinematic exploration of ordinary unhappiness is on some level a fantasy. “La La Land,” Damien Chazelle’s brazen attempt to reinvigorate the old-fashioned movie musical, is a fantasy on a lot of different levels. One is Emma Stone’s performance as a fresh-faced, quick-witted Los Angeles girl next door who happens to be an aspiring movie star.MORRIS: You and I are both guilty of pleading with the people who make our movies to please, pretty please, put Taraji P. Henson and Emma Stone in more of everything. And here they both are. It took only a few moments in a couple of movies to realize that the women were stars. They’ve got gale-force charisma that risks neglect and misuse. With Henson, I worried that the movies would throw up their hands in pre-emptive exasperation: “We just don’t the have the roles for her.” And since her first Oscar nomination as Brad Pitt’s mammy seven years ago, they really haven’t. With Stone, I worried that the only times we would see her best stuff would be at awards shows and when she played Peter Parker’s damsel in a dreary Spider-Man reboot.But “La La Land” is an ideal home for her sunlight and the clouds she can gather to obscure it. Everything she’s doing for Chazelle is on the surface, which is just right for a movie that needs her to start singing and dancing. You have to seem ready to join the joy — or, as is often the case here, the solemnity — of having a song in your heart. One reason to pick Stone over a lot of other actors for that kind of readiness is that her intelligence doesn’t get in her way. She has done all her thinking before we see her. How many good actors have a hard time giving themselves over to anything too small or normal, lest someone miss them acting? Or: How many actors have to work hard at appearing natural? Stone woke up like this. May the movies stay awake to her!SCOTT: My favorite Emma Stone moment in “La La Land” — and this is saying a lot — is a very small morsel of multidimensional bravura. Her character, Mia, is at an audition in the middle of a stressed-out, ordinary, young-person-in-Los-Angeles-looking-for-a-break kind of day. She’s supposed to react as someone breaks up with her over the phone, and Mia — Emma — gives it everything. Her eyes swell with unshed tears; her mouth crumples and freezes into a pained half-smile. And then someone interrupts, and the audition is over, and she makes her exasperated way down a corridor lined with pretty, petite redheads just like her. But we know she’s not just another interchangeable aspirant. We know, based on that audition, that Mia is a terrific actress. We already knew that about Emma Stone, but now somehow we know it even more.MORRIS: “La La Land” arrives at a moment in which the movies are diverging from Stardom 101: “This is who I am, and it won’t ever change too much.” Both she and her co-star Ryan Gosling — who’s also excellent, and appears to have recovered from that give-me-the-matches syndrome — are working on established personas, in a classical style that can result in serious work. (Ask Denzel Washington and Isabelle Huppert.) But ever since De Niro, I think seriousness in American acting has come to mean suffering and stress. His Jake LaMotta is a landmark piece of acting from which people continue to extract the wrong lesson. The achievement of that performance isn’t its physicality — it’s the psychological torture that defines and dictates it. (I have to say, the toll of playing that character seemed to wreck his acting for a decade.) That kind of madness might need the Method. But it has landed a lot of performers in the pits of mannerism too. Natalie Portman has been one of those actors: someone who needs the suffering to achieve the sublime. Her playing Jacqueline Kennedy in Pablo Larraín’s “Jackie” could have been more stunt work — the accent, the brittleness, the froideur. But I really like what an exercise in state of mind she makes it. She’s acting symbolism and tragedy in a way only partly to do with her husband’s assassination and everything to do with performing docility, sympathy, wifeliness, decorum, strength and bereavement for an expectant nation. Portman knows what to do with a symbol: make it mean something.She and Don Cheadle are the only actors in our group playing outsize cultural icons. That kind of acting is a gamble, obviously, because it can get too close to impersonation. We tend to value it nonetheless because we have a historical record by which to measure it. So my bias is always toward something completely new that has come from the inside out, something that invents more than reinvents. But I’m into certain reinventions too. Plain old stardom — the way Stone pursues it in “La La Land” — isn’t something we value as much in movies anymore. What we value now is visible work. One of the many things I love about all the fantastic film acting being done now is that some of these great performers understand how invisible works, too.Wesley Morris is a critic at large for The New York Times and a staff writer for the magazine.A.O.
