And Woods’s victory immediately reverberated beyond golf and, for that matter, sports.The win even led to a rare moment of agreement between President Trump and former President Barack Obama. “What a fantastic life comeback for a really great guy!’’ the President said on Twitter. “To come back and win the Masters after all the highs and lows is a testament to excellence, grit and determination,’’ Obama posted.Francesco Molinari entered the final round of the Masters alone in the lead by two strokes at 13 under. He stayed atop the leaderboard by himself until the last group — Molinari,  Tiger Woods and Tony Finau — got to the 12th tee.  At which point, Molinari proceeded to double bogey the hole and set up a wild finish in which six golfers at one point or another held at least a share of the lead. (Woods, Molinari, Xander Schauffele, Patrick Cantlay, Brooks Koepka, Dustin Johnson). There was briefly a five-way tie for first until Woods took sole possession of the lead for good at the 15th hole, where he birdied and Molinari made another double bogey.EagleBirdieBogeyDouble bogeyKEYPlayers’ final-round scores in parentheses.

At Augusta, on perhaps the sport’s biggest stage, was its seminal figure, suddenly back on top, which is where he was a decade ago when everything suddenly went sideways for him.What followed was a long, painful period of his life, in which his body repeatedly broke down and his marriage collapsed. But after prevailing on Sunday, Woods is back in the pantheon of the sports world’s biggest stars, back on a level with LeBron James, Serena Williams and Lionel Messi, back in a space he entered with his first Masters victory in 1997, when he was a skinny 21-year-old a year removed from Stanford who declared “Hello World” in a classic Nike commercial.“It’s unreal for me to experience this,’’ Woods said in a television interview after his victory on Sunday. “It was one of the hardest I’ve ever had to win just because of what’s transpired the last couple of years.”The long drought Woods endured between major championships — his previous one came at the 2008 United States Open — would have once seemed inconceivable. The same could be said for the 14 years it took for Woods to finally win his fifth title at Augusta National, a course so suited for his game that Nicklaus once predicted that Woods would collect more than the combined 10 Masters titles that he and Arnold Palmer won there.And yet there was an eerie familiarity to what took place on Sunday. Woods played his final round before crowds that were 10 to 12 deep for hundreds of yards at every hole — from tee box to green.In a sense, though, the gallery that really mattered to Woods was much smaller and consisted of his mother, Kultida, and his two children — his 10-year-old son, Charlie Axel, and his 11-year-old daughter, Sam Alexis. His children were among the first to greet him once his triumph was complete. Neither had been born when Woods basically ruled the sport.They essentially knew of their father’s exploits from photographs and other people’s memories — and they knew golf mostly as a game that had caused their father terrible distress. But not anymore.The years between Woods’s 14th and 15th victories in major tournaments included an immense number of setbacks, although his struggles actually date to the 2006 death of his father, Earl, who was his soulmate and putting guru. Two years later, Woods won the United States Open victory on a left leg in need of surgery, but a year after that, a marital dispute about his philandering led to a car accident and a succession of lurid headlines. A divorce followed in 2010.Tiger Woods’s record in the 11 years since his last victory in a major tournament.MAJORSM: THE MASTERSU: U.S. OPENB: BRITISH OPENPGA TOURNAMENTS ENTEREDTOP 10WONP: P.G.A.

That year, he hit rock bottom when he was charged with driving under the influence after he was found in a painkiller haze at the wheel of his car with the motor running.Woods said that when he was down, he gained strength from what he described as his children’s “infectious happiness.”“To have my kids here, it’s come full circle,” he said after Sunday’s final round. “My dad was here in ’97, and now I’m the dad with two kids there.”With a closing round of two-under-par 70, Woods edged two other major champions — Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka — as well as Xander Schauffele, a 25-year-old from San Diego. Woods’s 72-hole score of 13-under 275 was one shot better than his total in his 2005 victory at Augusta. And it was the first time that Woods, who started the day two strokes off the lead, had come from behind in the final round to win a major tournament.Woods’s children were also with him last summer when he saw the first real glimmers of hope in his comeback — at the British Open. They saw him play his way into contention over the first three days of that tournament and then briefly take the lead in the final round on his way to a tie for sixth. Afterward, he told his children that he hoped that they were proud of how he fought and refused to give up.At Augusta, his children arrived on Saturday night, providing extra motivation for Woods to prevail. Parenthood has imbued Woods with extra patience, which came in handy on the front nine on Sunday, when he made back-to-back bogeys while elsewhere on the course players were leapfrogging over one another and into contention with birdies and eagles. Indeed, late in Sunday’s round, 10 players, including Woods, were within two strokes of the lead.But amid that intense grouping, it was Woods who found a way to finish first.Woods’s first Masters title, in 1997, by an astounding 12 strokes, left an indelible mark on the sport. He became the first African-American — Woods is also half Thai — to win golf’s most exalted championship. He reshaped the game, making it more athletic and more popular — especially outside the United States.In 1997, the first person at Augusta to greet Woods as he came off the final hole in triumph was his father, whose grand plan Woods had realized with his victory. His mother was there, too. She was also on hand Sunday, but after her embrace, Woods took a few steps forward and was smothered by his second family — the other players, some of whom were almost young enough to be his children.Sunday’s final round was moved up five hours to avoid an ominous forecast for later in the day. Players were grouped in threesomes to speed play. Woods took the lead for good on the par 5 15th hole with a birdie putt. And when he then arrived at the 16th tee, a familiar face and friend — the record-setting swimmer Michael Phelps — was standing close enough to touch him.It was Phelps who had spent two months in a treatment center in 2014 after trying to self-medicate with alcohol. It was Phelps who became an informal counselor to Woods after the 2017 painkiller episode. And it was Phelps who was on hand as Woods closed out his comeback with his final putt.“When I tapped the putt in — I don’t know what I did,’’ Woods said. “I know I screamed.”And as he then put on the winner’s green jacket for a fifth time, he said something everyone knew but might have forgotten: “It fits.”Advertisement
