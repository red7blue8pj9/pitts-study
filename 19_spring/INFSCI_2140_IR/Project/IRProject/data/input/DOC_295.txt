ChowTo get into “Springsteen on Broadway,” you can either pay over a thousand dollars, or hope to steal some good fortune from “Lucky Town.”On Thursday, producers of Bruce Springsteen’s one-man Broadway show announced a digital lottery, similar to the popular “Ham4Ham” program for “Hamilton.” For every “Springsteen” performance, 26 tickets will be sold for $75 each. You can enter the lottery up to a week before a show, and the winners will be named 24 hours before each performance.The show had hoped to keep prices down by using Verified Fan, a new technology from Ticketmaster meant to weed out bots and high-volume scalpers. But prices have nevertheless soared on secondary markets like StubHub, with some tickets reaching $8,500, upsetting many fans.The show will feature Mr. Springsteen interweaving stories with classic songs from across his career. Mr. Springsteen hopes it will be more intimate than his typical stadium tours: “This is the closest thing to what I would have done at Max’s Kansas City in 1973, when I was coming up by myself,” he told Jon Pareles in a New York Times interview this month.Previews begin Oct. 3 at Walter Kerr Theater.
