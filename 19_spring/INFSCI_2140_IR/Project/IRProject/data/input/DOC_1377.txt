The administrators needed to figure out why students like this were struggling. So they did something that those in higher education rarely do: They looked to a competitor for help.The University of Texas had used predictive analysis to identify students at risk and devised early interventions to help them succeed. Kansas started using the Texas techniques, and found that 1,200 of the 1,500 students who were headed for trouble had not received any intervention, and officials moved to fix it.Over the last two generations, initiatives like the G.I. Bill and Pell Grants opened tremendous opportunities for Americans from a variety of backgrounds to attend colleges, once almost exclusively outposts for wealthy white families.But with that growth came attendant failures among first-generation students, who were often ill prepared for the rigors of college life, and educational institutions that were not designed to serve them. As tuitions have increased drastically, the ability to afford college has also impeded many students’ ability to complete their programs.In 2014, a consortium of 11 large, public research universities joined forces with the goal of increasing retention and graduation rates among roughly 400,000 undergraduate students around the country.“The reality is that if the institution is not designed around students, there are a series of booby traps that are unintentionally set that would trip up any student,” said Bridget Burns, the executive director of the consortium, the University Innovation Alliance, who noted that first-generation students face many such traps.“This seems like a really complicated issue to most people, but we look at it differently,” she said. “If you can actually redesign the institution, you will see improvements with those students.”The group uses data to predict where students may go wrong so they can receive extra help in those areas. The universities experimented with a variety of programs, like creating peer groups of students who would otherwise get lost, or helping them make good class choices and get remedial help.The alliance universities have increased the number of degrees awarded by 10 percent since the group’s inception, including a 25 percent increase among Pell Grant recipients.For students at greatest risk of dropping out — largely low income students and those whose parents did not attend college — some of the problems begin before they even walk on campus. Some schools found that students were overwhelmed by the ways schools communicated with incoming freshmen, often peppering them with emails and instructions they struggled to manage.“If they came from a family where no one had gone to college, they were so overwhelmed, they didn’t make the decisions that needed to be made,” like properly filling out financial aid forms, said Michael M. Crow, president of Arizona State University, a member of the alliance. “Or they dropped out.”Seemingly obvious fixes, like sending students information specific to their needs and interests, or condensing financial aid information into one package, have made a big difference.Participating schools have developed their own markers, which vary from college to college, to quickly identify students who are starting to struggle.On a Monday, for example, the school might apply a base of indicators to a group of students to look for red flags that week — things like a poor grade on a quiz, a missed meeting with an adviser, or failure to make a tuition payment.“Universities have been serving students for hundreds of years, and yet we have rarely looked at that data,” said Ms. Burns, noting that at Georgia State, the “most predictive indicator of success is that first grade in the first class” of a major program. In many cases, she said, students have not arrived with the skills they need for a particular subject, despite strong grades in that area in high school.Traditionally, she said, students were allowed to carry on, when immediate intervention was needed. “Usually schools intervene when they are too far gone,” she said.Often, first-generation students struggle with picking the right classes, racking up a bunch of credits on a path to nowhere. Many schools in the consortium are working to help students define a major earlier to prevent the hodgepodge, or to take classes that would fulfill the requirements toward a number of related majors, so time and financial aid are not wasted.Creating a better sense of community for students from families for which college is a new experience can be the most simple but important step, especially for students of color in predominantly white institutions, and those who are surrounded by students who come from largely higher income families.“They get scared and lonely and drop out before they can give it a chance,” said Diane Jones, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute. “If you don’t have the money to go off to the bars you might feel socially isolated.”For instance, the University of Texas in Austin has created a University Leadership Network that connects students who, based on their data points, are less likely to graduate on time. They study together, work on internships and get other means of support.But beyond individual programs, education experts said they believe the greatest value in the consortium is the member universities’ willingness to share information about what works on their campuses, so that success stories can be duplicated.“What is unique about what they are doing is that they are really focused on taking it to scale,” Ms. Jones said. “They are seeing that collectively they can figure out things and maybe we will all save money because you don’t have to reinvent the wheel for the fifth time.”Advertisement
