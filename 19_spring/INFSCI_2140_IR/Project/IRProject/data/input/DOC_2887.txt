AdvertisementSupported byBy The New York TimesPresident Trump on Thursday responded to Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California one day after Ms. Pelosi wrote him suggesting a delay to the annual State of the Union address because of the government shutdown.[For more coverage of Mr. Trump’s letter, read here.]The following is the text of Mr. Trump’s letter as released by the White House.__________Dear Madame Speaker:Due to the Shutdown, I am sorry to inform you that your trip to Brussels, Egypt, and Afghanistan has been postponed. We will reschedule this seven-day excursion when the Shutdown is over. In light of the 800,000 great American workers not receiving pay, I am sure you would agree that postponing this public relations event is totally appropriate. I also feel that, during this period, it would be better if you were in Washington negotiating with me and joining the Strong Border Security movement to end the Shutdown. Obviously, if you would like to make your journey by flying commercial, that would certainly be your prerogative.I look forward to seeing you soon and even more forward to watching our open and dangerous Southern Border finally receive the attention, funding, and security it so desperately deserves!Sincerely,Donald TrumpAdvertisement
