AdvertisementSupported byBy Katherine SchultenUpdated: April 4, 2019_________It is difficultto get the news from poemsyet men die miserably every dayfor lackof what is found there.–William Carlos Williams, from “Asphodel, That Greeny Flower”We go hard for National Poetry Month here on The Learning Network, and as The Times kept publishing news and features about poetry and poets, we keep adding more and more ways to teach about it — during April or any other month.Below, a piece we first published in 2017 but have updated annually since. It now has over 20 ideas for helping even the most verse averse find something to enjoy._________This Book Review piece asks well-known people like John Green, Shonda Rhimes, Alan Cumming and Stephen King, “What’s Your Favorite Poem?” and links to answers from Yeats to Gwendolyn Brooks.Ask your students to find a favorite poem and write or talk about what it means to them. For more inspiration, they might visit The Favorite Poem Project and watch videos like this one:________One April, The Times challenged readers to create so-called blackout poems by redacting words from articles by using a fun online tool.Try the tool out with your students, and consider it a warm-up for our 10th Annual Spring Poetry Contest for Teenagers, which this year asks for blackout poetry. You can find all the rules, and lots and lots of inspiration, here.Our blackout poetry contest is new for 2019, but from 2010-2018 we ran a similar kind of student contest every April.Our Found Poem Contest challenged teenagers to use any article they liked from any edition of The Times, past or present, to create verse simply by rearranging the words.Every year, teachers across the curriculum participated. We’ve had science-themed winners on the cosmos and fruit flies; current-events-focused finalists on topics like the Syrian refugee crisis and the Boston Marathon bombing; and history-steeped verse that used archival reporting on events like the sinking of the Titanic and World War II.To inspire your students to create their own, have them look through the work of some past winners. For instance, here is “Amy,” by Epiphany Jones, which was created with some words “found” in a 2011 obituary, “Amy Winehouse, British Soul Singer With a Troubled Life, Dies at 27,” and a 2007 article on the singer, “Disillusioned Diva With Glimmers of Soul.”_________You may already be familiar with our weekly “What’s Going On in This Picture” photojournalism exercise. Well, in 2016, we experimented with a live, moderated “What’s Going On in This Poem?” discussion, using the same three questions we apply weekly to photos. This time, though, we asked participants about “Taking It Home to Jerome,” a poem from the Magazine’s weekly column:• What’s going on in this poem?• What do you see, or read, that makes you say that?• What more can you find?Follow the whole discussion here to see how those three simple questions opened up a world of possibilities. Then, perhaps, try it yourself with another poem from the weekly Magazine column. For example, what would your students have to say about “Hoodie,” by January Gill O’Neil?_________To celebrate the opening of the National Museum of African-American History and Culture in 2016, The Times ran Langston Hughes’s poem “I, Too” by itself on a full page of the print paper.Two people who worked on the design explain why in this piece. As the art director says, “Langston Hughes’s words are so powerful, there was no need for design adornment. In this case, less proves to be more.”If The Times were to give over another whole page to a poem right now, what should it be and why?_________The Times’s old Room for Debate column once challenged seven experts to discuss this question, and some of the answers are a kind of poetry in themselves.Elsewhere in the Opinion section, William Logan asks, “Poetry: Who Needs It?” and, in “A Poet’s Boyhood at the Burning Crossroads,” Saeed Jones writes about how, as a teenager, poetry helped him “shatter silence into language.”Finally, your students might be familiar with popular “Instapoets” like Rupi Kaur, who lean to aphoristic, confessional and inspirational verse, often brief enough to fit into a tweet, or to be overlaid on a photo or an illustration. Is this “greeting-card verse” or real poetry? Why?Have your students read any or all of these, then debate the question in your classroom: Does poetry matter?_________From 2010 to 2016 we ran a regular feature we called Poetry Pairings. In each, we matched a poem selected by the Poetry Foundation with an article from The Times that in some way echoed, extended or challenged the poem’s words and themes.You can find the full collection here, and use our related Teaching and Learning Ideas For Any Poetry-News Pairing with any of them.After reading a few, challenge your students to do what we did: match a poem to a piece from The Times, or any other news source. How does reading them together deepen and broaden them both?_________T Magazine regularly takes a never-before-published poem and pairs it with a newly commissioned work of contemporary art — bringing aesthetic life to the written word.For instance, the photo above, by the artist Christian Marclay, is in response to a poem called “Greece” by Billy Collins. Find them both here, then invite your students to scroll through the full collection for inspiration to create their own._________In “Galaxies in His Head,” Stephen Burt writes about the poet Terrance Hayes and how he “uses poetry to show that there is more to him, and to anyone, than what you expect.”Watch the video above and read the full article. How might your students use poetry to show others that there is more to them than what people expect?If they would like to go further with the theme, invite them to read this collection of new work from 10 poets with disabilities. As Jennifer Bartlett writes, “For many of us, [poetry] is also a way of ‘being in the world,’ a world that in many ways was not made for us and actively resists our participation. Through poetry, we are able to remake and reinvent that world.”_________“Poetry prevents everybody from feeling lonely,” says Nikki Giovanni in this video. “If I had a friend in the hospital, I would read a poem. But then, friends who get married, they read a poem. And then friends who die say, ‘Read this poem at my funeral’ … Poetry is there with us, a part of us. Poetry is something we carry in our hearts.”Challenge students to think about someone they know who might need the gift of a poem. What poem would they give this person, and why?_________Metaphors are everywhere, points out the Opinion columnist David Brooks. We often use food metaphors to describe the world of ideas and war metaphors to talk about argument.Have students keep a journal for one day in which they record every metaphor they come across in print or speech. Then, have them react to this column, and to thoughts like, “To be aware of metaphors is to be humbled by the complexity of the world, to realize that deep in the undercurrents of thought there are thousands of lenses popping up between us and the world, and that we’re surrounded at all times by what Steven Pinker of Harvard once called ‘pedestrian poetry.’ ”Then, invite them to see how one young writer — Amanda Gorman, the national youth poet laureate — uses metaphors in her work, as in “Waiting With the Gourd Moon,” the piece she wrote for Black History Month that the Times has animated, above._________ Read about the Twitter poems created by well-known poets like Billy Collins, Claudia Rankine, Elizabeth Alexander and Robert Pinsky. Then have students visit the hashtags #poetweet or #micropoetry on Twitter to see current examples, and to post their own.Our lesson Less Is More: Using Social Media to Inspire Concise Writing has even more poetry ideas._________“When you imagine a poetry reading, the scene that comes to mind probably doesn’t involve battalions of underwear-slinging admirers,” begins a 2011 article about open mike night and poetry slams around New York City.View this related slide show, then invite students to attend a local poetry slam, or watch “Def Poetry Jam.” You might even stage your own classroom, schoolwide or community event.And to convince your students to write, rewrite, edit and polish before their work is ready for the world to hear, share with them “Poetry in Action.” In this feature, six contemporary writers, like Billy Collins and Jenny Zhang, share images of their own poems-in-process and discuss the revisions they made._________Poetry Magazine celebrated its 100th year in print in 2012, and one thing keeping it fresh, this article reports, is poetry apps for readers’ smartphones. Above, a video review of even more poetry apps.How would your students help infuse our smartphone and social-media-obsessed world with poetry in ways guaranteed to intrigue readers their age?_________Read about some new anthologies of poetry that explore a coming zombie apocalypse, and have students create their own undead-inspired verse, whether via limerick, haiku, or sonnets.Are zombies just metaphors for things like capitalism or racism? See what some in the article contend, then find evidence in popular culture for or against that interpretation._________• After watching and listening to “Mary Oliver’s Provincetown: A Poet’s Landscape,” or reading “For Wallace Stevens, Hartford as Muse,” or “The Bridge, My Muse,” have students look through personal photographs of favorite places then write poems inspired by them. Host an event in which students read their poems accompanied by a slide show of images.• Or, read about the visual art/poetry collaboration that commemorated life at Chicago’s Cabrini-Green housing project as its last building was demolished. Have students write poems about a place they remember from their own lives, or give them a common topic (something like their current school or the town park). Plan a site-specific event, perhaps a poetry walk through the place, having the poems read, projected on structures, written in chalk on sidewalks, or otherwise displayed. You might also collaborate with dancers, musicians and visual artists to perform or present their related work at the event._________Post poems in unexpected places the way David Ellis does with his “driftwood haiku”:A German shepherd tied to a rusted gate, blackfish simmered with tomatoes on a grill, a scuba diver emerging from the waters of the Bronx: These are the scenes that inspire the poetry of Mr. Ellis, the self-proclaimed Bard of City Island. He composes haiku on seashells and driftwood about the daily serendipity of the mile-and-a-half-long island, leaving them around the neighborhood for people, like the woman who reads his poems every morning when she walks her dog. His works, locals say, add unexpected reflection to their day. Last January, Mr. Ellis self-published a book of haiku called “Beach in City Island,” and he is now working on a children’s edition, which his [six-year-old] son is illustrating.For example, students might leave poems around your school — perhaps inspired by these subway poets. Ask students to choose poems they have studied in school or elsewhere (or their own original works), then print and tape them to cafeteria tables, bathroom mirrors, hallway walls, or even write in chalk on campus sidewalks. How do people respond? What can you learn from that?You might show students the Everyday Poems for City Sidewalk project in St. Paul, or the Poetry in Motion program in the New York City subway, to get an idea of what kinds of poems work well as public pieces._________When the poet Mary Oliver died in January, 2019, many, including students who had first discovered her work in the classroom, mourned.One essayist, Steven Petrow, wrote a piece called “Mary Oliver’s Poems Taught Me How to Live,” about the accessible writer who changed his understanding of poetry, and asked “tough, imponderable life questions” through her verse.What poems have taught your students important lessons about how to live, what to value, how to see, feel, think or communicate? Why?_____“Like virtually everything else in the Trump era, poetry has gotten sharply political these days,” wrote The Times in 2017. The article continues:Writers are responding to this turbulent moment in the country’s history with a tsunami of poems that address issues like immigration, global warming, the Syrian refugee crisis, institutionalized racism, equal rights for transgender people, Islamophobia and health care....Poets are using social media to respond quickly to the news, posting new verses online. Hours after the election results came in on Nov. 8, Danez Smith, a 27-year-old poet in Minneapolis, wrote a poem about losing faith in the country, titled “You’re Dead, America.” It was published on BuzzFeed on Nov. 9, and includes the verses, “on the TV/ is the man from TV/ is gonna be president/ he has no word/ & hair beyond simile/ you’re dead, America.” Smith, who identifies with neither gender and prefers no courtesy title, has also written poems about health care and police violence, which have been used on signs and read aloud at Black Lives Matter protests.How might your students use poetry to express their reactions to what is happening in the world today? What published poetry can they find that helps them make sense of it?One possibility: reading the work of the United States poet laureate, Tracy K. Smith, or listening to her podcast, The Slowdown. In an essay on politics and poetry, she writes that political poetry has become a means of owning up to the complexity of our problems, and introduces the reader to some, like Justin Phillip Reed and Evie Shockley, who are doing it well. She writes:Poems willing to enter into this fraught space don’t merely stand on the bank calling out instructions on how or what to believe; they take us by the arm and walk us into the lake, wetting us with the muddied and the muddled, and sometimes even the holy.Invite your students to find or create political poems that address the issues they think are important — and that do so in a way that “take us by the arm and walk us into the lake.”_________The author Adam Bradley is quoted in this book review as calling hip-hop “the most widely disseminated poetry in the history of the world” and noting that rap “is poetry, but its popularity relies in part on people not recognizing it as such.” Do your students agree?Host a debate in which students pit poetry against rap or other lyrics. Do lyrics need to be well-crafted for a song to be good? Can lyrics be considered poetry? Why or why not? Should both forms be held to the same artistic standards? To extend the activity, you might have musically inclined students set poems they have studied in school to music — and read lyrics aloud without musical accompaniment.Or, use our lesson plan on Jay-Z’s writing process to find many more ideas._________Have students choose a poem they will learn by heart and recite. Find tips to transform this potentially daunting task into a meaningful experience (and one students may look forward to repeating) in our lesson plan, By Heart.You might see what other students have chosen by reading responses to a 2011 Student Opinion question, What Would You Like to Have Memorized?And if they need inspiration,the Op-Ed “Memorize That Poem!” should do the trick. In it, one writer explains why everyone should memorize a bit of poetry as “a lifeline — to grapple with overwhelming emotion or preserve sanity,” as well as to “find your kindred spirits across the centuries.”_________Poems are the only form of education to which girls like Meena Muska have access:Meena lost her fiancé last year, when a land mine exploded. According to Pashtun tradition, she must marry one of his brothers, which she doesn’t want to do. She doesn’t dare protest directly, but reciting poetry to Amail allows her to speak out against her lot. When I asked how old she was, Meena responded in a proverb: “I am like a tulip in the desert. I die before I open, and the waves of desert breeze blow my petals away.” She wasn’t sure of her age but thought she was 17. “Because I am a girl, no one knows my birthday,” she said.Invite students to read this piece to understand the power of verse in a place where poetry has “long been a form of rebellion for Afghan women, belying the notion that they are submissive or defeated.”What other powerful poems of rebellion and resilience can they find?_________Do you teach poetry with a Times article or feature?
