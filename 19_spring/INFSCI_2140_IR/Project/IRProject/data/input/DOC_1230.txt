Tomsheck, citing an effort to strengthen investigations, particularly into episodes involving shootings and other use of force by border agents.Mark A. Morgan, the deputy assistant director for inspections at the F.B.I., will take over as interim head of the border agency’s internal affairs office this month, a spokesman for the agency, Chris O’Neil, said Monday. He said Mr. Morgan would work with the Department of Homeland Security′s inspector general and other officials “on investigating allegations and complaints, specifically regarding use of force.”Last month, Gil Kerlikowske, the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, published for the first time the Border Patrol’s guidelines on the use of force, saying he was seeking new accountability in the agency. At least 28 people have been killed by Border Patrol agents since 2010, but the results of investigations into those episodes have not been made public, and it is unclear whether any agents have been punished.The Los Angeles Times first reported the removal of Mr. Tomsheck, who took over as assistant commissioner for the Office of Internal Affairs in June 2006.Advertisement
