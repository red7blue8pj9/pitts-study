On some issues — like abortion, guns and immigration — Democrats really do face this difficult choice. The policies that excite progressives alienate many of the white working-class voters who swung the 2016 election to Donald Trump, and vice versa.But there is also one huge area where no such tradeoff exists: economic policy.On economic issues, the politics are really quite simple. The Democratic base and swing voters have remarkably similar preferences. And those preferences are quite progressive.On one issue after another, a majority of Americans want aggressive action to respond to the problems facing the middle class and poor: generous Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security; a higher minimum wage; more financial aid for college; and more federal action to create good-paying jobs.In my column this morning, I argue that this is a time for big, progressive policy ideas. I also talk about some of the work now being done to sketch out those ideas, because the details are important.If you’re interested in the topic, I recommend Annie Lowrey’s interview with Representative Ro Khanna in The Atlantic; Jamelle Bouie in Slate on the relationship between racism and ambitious economic ideas; Eric Levitz in New York magazine on a federal jobs guarantee; Gilad Edelman in Washington Monthly on antitrust policy; and Dylan Matthews in Vox on child poverty.North Korea. Kim Jong-un’s decision to suspend North Korea’s nuclear and missile testing might look like surrender; it isn’t, argues The Los Angeles Times’s Tracy Wilkinson. “Kim can afford to suspend tests because,” she writes, “his nuclear arsenal is complete — and capable, he claims, of attacking the United States.” Any summit with the United States now is likely to result in North Korea becoming “unofficially recognized as a nuclear power” — arguably Kim’s goal all along.In The Times, my newsroom colleague Amy Chozick engages in some candid self-criticism for her coverage of John Podesta’s emails, which Russia hacked to damage Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign. “It wasn’t a scoop. It was more like a bank heist,” she wrote in yesterday’s Sunday Review. The essay is adapted from her forthcoming book, “Chasing Hillary,” out Tuesday.This issue is much bigger than any one reporter. In a 2017 column, I also looked at the Podesta email coverage. I agree the media should have done better. It’s worth some reflection, because hacked emails and other information are likely to be a recurring problem.You can join me on Twitter (@DLeonhardt) and Facebook.
