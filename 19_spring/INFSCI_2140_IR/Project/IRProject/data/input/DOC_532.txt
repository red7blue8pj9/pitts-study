But a weekend house in the Hudson Valley, an hour or two north of the city, can be surprisingly affordable in comparison.For those preparing to look for a city escape now that the weather is warming up, we charted median sale prices over the last few years in several Hudson Valley counties, using information from Trulia.com, the real estate listings website. (Counties where closing prices weren’t reliably reported were not included in Trulia’s data.)The upshot? In nearly every county we examined, sale prices have been relatively flat — good news for buyers. Those searching for bargains might want to focus on Sullivan and Ulster counties, on the less-chic western side of the Hudson River, where prices were among the most affordable.Hudson Valley Sale PricesDec.2016Dec.2017Dec.2018Dec.2015$192,700$196,500$228,400Albany County$213,500$202,600$196,000$226,200Columbia County$221,100$201,000 $204,900$227,900Orange County$230,800 $286,500$290,900 $312,700Putnam County$328,000 $173,400$150,800 $157,100$174,000 Rensselaer County$105,100$121,200$123,000Sullivan County$124,700$178,900$194,800 $202,200Ulster County$207,300Hudson Valley Sale PricesDec.2016Dec.2017Dec.2018Dec.2015Albany County$192,700$196,500$228,400$213,500Columbia County$226,200$202,600$196,000$221,100Orange County$201,000 $204,900$227,900$230,800 Putnam County$312,700$286,500$290,900 $328,000 Sullivan County$105,100$121,200$123,000$124,700Rensselaer County$173,400$150,800 $157,100$174,000 Ulster County$178,900$194,800 $202,200$207,300Source: Trulia.comBy The New York TimesFor weekly email updates on residential real estate news, sign up here.
