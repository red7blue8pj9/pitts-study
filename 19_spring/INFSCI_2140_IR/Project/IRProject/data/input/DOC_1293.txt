His videos have attracted nearly 14.7 billion views.In December, Forbes magazine estimated that Mr. Kjellberg had earned $15 million in the year that ended last June, thanks largely to his book, “This Book Loves You,” and his series on YouTube Red, Google’s paid subscription service, which offers ad-free viewing among other benefits.One of the videos identified by The Journal featured a man dressed as Jesus Christ saying, “Hitler did absolutely nothing wrong.” In another, Mr. Kjellberg hired two men to make and display a sign that said, “Death to All Jews,” according to The Journal.PewDiePie removed those videos, along with a third, but not before they had amassed about 23 million views, The Journal reported. All three were published last month.Mr. Kjellberg addressed the criticism in a Sunday post on Tumblr, the popular blogging platform.“I think it’s important to say something, and I want to make one thing clear: I am in no way supporting any kind of hateful attitudes,” he said. He added: “Though this was not my intention, I understand that these jokes were ultimately offensive.”Mr. Kjellberg did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment on Monday night.The Walt Disney Company zealously defends its brand — it decided not to bid for Twitter last year in part because it was concerned with trolls on that social network — but this is not the first time that the entertainment conglomerate has had trouble from off-brand units. In 2010, for example, it sold the sometimes-racy Miramax Films.In 2014, Disney paid $500 million for Maker Studios in a bid to expand its reach online. In the intervening years, however, Maker Studios has suffered from layoffs and retrenchments.Brooks Barnes contributed reporting.Advertisement
