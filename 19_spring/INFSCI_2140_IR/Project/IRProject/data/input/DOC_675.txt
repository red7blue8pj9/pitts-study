We invite you to take a look at this year’s winners ...CreditCreditFelicita SalaSupported byBy The New York TimesSince 1952, we’ve convened a rotating annual panel of three expert judges, who consider every illustrated children’s book published that year in the United States. They select the winners purely on the basis of artistic merit. The judges this time were Leonard Marcus, a children’s literature historian and critic; Jenny Rosenoff, a children’s librarian at the New York Public Library; and Bryan Collier, the author and illustrator of many acclaimed picture books and a past winner of the award. Below you’ll find images from each winning book, with commentary from the judges.
