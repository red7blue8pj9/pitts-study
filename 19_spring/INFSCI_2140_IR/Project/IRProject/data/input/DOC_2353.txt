It’s literally at the end of the road, connected to the mainland by a little two-lane strip of asphalt with water lapping at its edges.Families have lived there for generations, making their livings on the surrounding waters. Time moves more slowly there, and a person’s sense of home, family and community is deep-rooted. Perhaps this is why the island was the inspiration for “The Bathtub,” the fictional setting for Benh Zeitlin’s Oscar-nominated 2012 film, “Beasts of the Southern Wild.” Like the fictional characters in that film, the islanders share a profound love for their home and don’t want to leave – something many of us can relate to.The island is a ground zero for climate change – affected by rising sea levels, coastal erosion, and increasingly severe storms. Experts predict that these problems will soon confront coastal areas around the world. As another hurricane season begins this week, residents are aware of the threat to their home. What is it like to experience these changes, knowing there is little to nothing you can do to stop them?In this Op-Doc video, I explore this question with lifelong residents – weaving their experiences and memories together to create a small portrait of this beautiful place. I am extremely thankful for the time I spent with Edison Dardar, as well as Chris, Juliette and Howard Brunet, who are featured in this film. The love and concern they show for their home is all the more poignant because it all may soon disappear.Advertisement
