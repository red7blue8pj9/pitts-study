But the authenticity of the orgasms is only one of the company’s distinguishing features; in an industry not known for its respectful treatment of performers (known here as “models”), Kink offers a safe, consensual workplace where the submissives are in charge.Guiding us through this world of rules and “aftercare” — which usually entails hugs and deep breathing — the director, Christina Voros, adopts an educational approach that embraces the pleasure within the pain. Here, a model is not only willing to accept the ungentle ministrations of what looks like a rotating drill bit, but she’s also ecstatic, entering a trancelike state that beats more conventional job perks. Overheard conversations include the cheery (“Are you doing anal? Wonderful!”) and the ominous (“We’re gonna need a longer pipe”), and interviews with employees are as likely to feature feminist views on pornography as to demonstrate the safest way to step on a penis.Filmed in the company’s headquarters in San Francisco — where its values-driven founder, Peter Acworth, proudly displays portraits of his mother and sister — “Kink” is filled with affable professionals, Oscar-worthy erections and useful tips for your leisure time. Only once did I experience a twinge of dread, as Mr. Acworth’s tour is interrupted by unearthly noises somewhere behind him.“I don’t know if you want to investigate that?” he offers, politely. Speaking for myself, I’m good. Movie data powered by IMDb.comOpens on Friday Directed by Joel Soisson 1 hour 31 minutes; not ratedAdvertisement
