Although Senator Biden voted against the final confirmation of Mr. Thomas, his condescending treatment of Anita Hill, along with the actions of his all-male, all-white Judiciary Committee, gave us a Supreme Court justice whose rulings have been in opposition to every progressive cause that Mr. Biden has championed throughout his career. The message his committee sent to any woman who had been sexually harassed or assaulted was no different from the one we hear from today’s Judiciary Committee: Your experience doesn’t matter.We may forgive, but we don’t forget.Liza KetchumWatertown, Mass.Advertisement
