AdvertisementSupported byHow Ivy League resentments took over the Kavanaugh debate.By Ross DouthatOpinion ColumnistA week ago, Elizabeth Bruenig of The Washington Post wrote a column about the dreadful feeling of being yanked back, thanks to the allegations of teenage sexual assault against Brett Kavanaugh, into the cliques and cruelties of high school: “And there we were, poring over the juvenile ephemera of a high schooler’s yearbook, trying to understand what it meant, what it means, with the same unsettled frustration of outsiders looking in on a clique’s jokes.”There is only one feeling as grim as the one that she described, and it’s the feeling of being yanked back into a particular kind of college experience — the elite kind, the hyper-meritocratic kind, the Ivy League kind, the kind that inspires people to write insufferable columns like this one in which sociological observation becomes an excuse to remind your readers that you went to college “in New Haven” or “near Boston” or wherever Princeton is.But here we are, with Brett Kavanaugh’s college drinking and his social place at Yale suddenly the terrain of discussion and debate while we await the F.B.I.’s reporting. And of course, like any other Ivy-educated journalist, I think I have something to contribute to this awful, privilege-mongering discussion.In particular, the portrait of meritocratic social life that’s being drawn, usually by other elite-educated journalists to explain who Kavanaugh was in college — the prep school jock, drinking with his buddies and starting bar fights while his less-privileged classmates looked on askance — is at once terribly familiar and significantly incomplete.A good place to start is with the recent New York magazine account of Kavanaugh’s freshman dorm room, apparently a subterranean pit with vomit stains in the bathroom whose other occupants and the future Supreme Court nominee barely spoke to one another. The author, Lisa Miller, describes the general early-80s freshman scene at Yale like this:Many … that year describe the social life on campus as extremely tribal and isolating, with the elites and legacies hanging with each other, dominating and creating ripples of inarticulate fear, while the outsiders — the nerds and the scholarship kids and the people of color — circled the outskirts seeking friendly alliances.So on the one hand, yes: When I went to Harvard 15 years later, the dynamic on campus freshman year was similar. The prep school kids arrived with pre-forged friend groups, fake IDs, a patina of sophistication and a heavy dose of arrogance, and their social scene was an intimidating fortress around which the rest of campus social life swirled and eddied. I knew lots of kids with backgrounds like Brett Kavanaugh’s or even more so (since, after all, he went to a Catholic school rather than one of the old Protestant ones; grew up near D.C., not New York; went to Beach Week rather than the Hamptons …), and I was great friends with some of them individually while always feeling uncomfortable, out of place, chip firmly planted on shoulder in the atmosphere that they created all together. And my friends who came from working-class or immigrant backgrounds generally found their scene more alienating still.But now hit pause for a moment, because if you read this and then go look me up on Wikipedia (actually, please don’t) you’ll see that I also attended something that could be reasonably described as a prep school — so who am I, exactly, to declare that there was some huge distance between myself and the Kavanaugh types, or any other preppy clique?And with that question you’ve struck to the heart of the whole meritocratic game, which depends on a reproduction of privilege that pretends to be something else, something fair and open and all about hard work and just deserts. In this game the people whose privilege is particularly obvious, the boarding schoolers and New York toffs and Bethesda country clubbers, play a crucially important role. It’s not just that their parents pay full freight and keep the economics of tuition viable for everyone. It’s that the eliter-than-elite kids themselves help create a provisional inside-the-Ivy hierarchy that lets all the other privileged kids, the ones who are merely upper-upper middle class, feel the spur of resentment and ambition that keeps us running, keeps us competing, keeps us sharp and awful in all the ways that meritocracy requires.It’s basically the dynamic depicted in David Fincher’s “The Social Network,” which was somewhat factually iffy in its portrait of Facebook’s founding but totally true to the culture in which the social-media giant was incubated — a culture in which echt-preppies like the Winklevii, Mark Zuckerberg's rivals, exist so other slightly-less-privileged kids can hate them, and work twice as hard to beat them, and then tell themselves that they were underdogs all along.But a truer wisdom requires challenging this illusion. Go back to the Lisa Miller story for New York magazine, and the stratification it describes — the preppies on top, the “nerds and the scholarship kids and the people of color” struggling below. Then remember that many “people of color” at Ivy League schools are themselves children of affluence and privilege, and that with a very few exceptions everyone who goes to an Ivy League school is a nerd — Brett Kavanaugh very much included. So when Miller depicts Kavanaugh as a jock lording it over the dorks, she’s really describing one kind of nerd lording it over another kind, Bruenig’s high school nightmare recreating itself among people who are all tools and grinds and weirdos by any reasonable American standard — with all the dysfunction that such a hothouse world contains.Also, note the parenthetical disclosure in the story, where Miller explains how she got in touch with Kavanaugh’s freshman roommate Kit Winter and a friend of his, Itamar Kubovy, who visited their unhappy dorm room: “Editor’s note: Winter, Kubovy, and I went to high school together in New Haven, and Winter’s family and mine were friends.” That “high school” was Hopkins, currently ranked as the second-best private high school in Connecticut (fullest-possible disclosure: mine is ranked No. 14). So the story Miller is telling is about how a jock from the No. 5 private high school in Maryland was a jerk to his roommate who went to the No. 2 private high school in Connecticut, and who years later communicated the story to a reporter who also went to that same No. 2 private high school, who then wrote it up as a tale of social stratification for our times.To be clear, there are genuine working-class kids at Ivy League schools, and nerds whose nerdery is too pure for them to care about social networking, and minority or immigrant kids who come in with zero preparation for the rarefied environment and find themselves adrift and miserable. But a great many of the people who populate those schools, a great many of the people who complain about preppy creeps and rich jocks even as they try to imitate them, a great many of the people whose essays on What Kavanaugh Represents are populating elite-media websites these days, are much more like the “elites and legacies” than their self-image permits them to admit.That knowledge should color how we interpret the current frenzy of stories about his character and world. I have said before that I think there’s a reasonable case for withdrawing Kavanaugh’s nomination, and his angry partisanship and evasiveness under cross-examination last week did not make me optimistic about what his elevation will mean for the country.But people also need to recognize that the “profile” we’re being given of Kavanaugh — a creature of privilege who drank a lot in college and sometimes struck other people as a jerk — isn’t the narrow profile of a rapist, and isn’t even the somewhat more expansive profile of a particular kind of arrogant preppy. It’s a profile that fits many of the same people attacking him today — and so part of what we’re watching is one group of meritocrats returning to their undergraduate resentments and trying to pin on Georgetown Prep graduates the vices that define our entire depressing class.If I had known Brett Kavanaugh casually freshman year of college, I probably would have disliked him. But across four years at Harvard I watched the freshman-fall patterns of the preppiest students get imitated, adopted and reproduced by, well, most of us. And I often found that the worst people in that elite culture — including myself on my worst days — weren’t the most privileged kids but the hyper-ambitious ones obsessed with vaulting over them.So if his critics want to deny Brett Kavanaugh the highest office in our meritocracy on the grounds that he’s in denial or dishonest about the person he was at 18 or 22 — well, I just hope that those critics will save some of that cup of condemnation for themselves.Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion), join the Facebook political discussion group, Voting While Female, and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.
