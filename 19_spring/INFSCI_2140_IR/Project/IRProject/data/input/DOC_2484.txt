In orbit aboard the International Space Station, the astronaut wasn’t just gathering data for NASA’s Twins Study. He also produced some, well, stellar images.CreditCreditAstronaut Scott Kelly taking a selfie in October 2015, during a space walk conducted during his year in space.Supported byPhotographs by Scott KellyIt was not supposed to be a photo safari. NASA lofted Scott Kelly into orbit aboard the International Space Station in March 2015 for a year so that scientists could learn what happens to the human body during long missions in space. (A lot, as it turned out.) But between blood draws and equipment repairs, Mr. Kelly aimed a Nikon D4 toward the windows of the space station’s cupola or — his preferred spot — a porthole in the floor of a laboratory module. A snowstorm over the East Coast, the ethereal aurora, the Pantone deserts of North Africa, the vast swirl of the Caribbean — Mr. Kelly captured it all and then shared it, turning Twitter into an eye on Earth. Many of the images are collected in a book, “Infinite Wonder,” published in October.One day the data gleaned from Mr. Kelly’s medical experiments may open the door to new worlds. His photos gave us an unrivaled glimpse at the one we’ve already got. Advertisement
