Putin of Russia was trying to “break the North Atlantic alliance,” staking out a tougher stance on Russia during a confirmation hearing for defense secretary than his prospective commander in chief did on the campaign trail.“I’m all for engagement, but we also have to recognize reality,” General Mattis told the Senate Armed Services Committee. “There’s a decreasing number of areas where we can engage cooperatively and increasing numbers of areas where we’re going to have to confront Russia.”In a three-hour hearing, General Mattis argued for expanding the armed forces, improving the military’s readiness to go into battle on short notice and reinvigorating the North Atlantic Treaty Organization by maintaining a permanent armed American presence in Baltic nations to deter a Russian attack, among other steps.“My view is that nations with allies thrive and nations without allies don’t,” General Mattis said.Those remarks were a striking contrast to comments by President-elect Donald J. Trump during the campaign that American support for the alliance should be conditional on financial contributions by its members.After the hearing, General Mattis took a major step toward confirmation when the Republican-led Senate decisively approved a waiver that would permit him to become defense secretary, by a vote of 81 to 17. Separately, the House Armed Services Committee narrowly backed a waiver for him, 34 to 28 along party lines.Military officers are barred by law from serving as defense secretary unless they have been retired for seven years; General Mattis left active duty in May 2013. His supporters hope that Mr. Trump will sign legislation enabling him to begin service as the Pentagon chief on the new president’s first day in office so that his nomination and confirmation can quickly follow.In his testimony on Thursday, General Mattis won over most of the Senate panel’s Democrats as they seemed to invest in him their hopes that he will rein in some of Mr. Trump’s more impetuous national security impulses. In return, General Mattis gave them plenty of reason for hope.In addition to his remarks skeptical of Russia and supportive of NATO, General Mattis tacked to the left of President-elect Trump and most of the Republicans in Congress on whether to keep the agreement constraining Iran’s nuclear program. Mr. Trump has said that his top priority is to “dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran.” But General Mattis urged the United States to take steps to rigorously enforce it.“I think it is an imperfect arms control agreement — it’s not a friendship treaty,” he said. “But when America gives her word, we have to live up to it and work with our allies.”General Mattis also said he had no intention of revisiting Obama administration decisions on social issues at the Defense Department, including the opening of combat roles to women or allowing openly gay men and women to serve.“I believe that military service is a touchstone for patriots of whatever stripe,” he said. “I’ve never cared much about two consenting adults and who they go to bed with.”Trying to reassure lawmakers that he would not be too quick to urge the use of military force, General Mattis said the nickname he had been given, “Mad Dog,” was an invention of the news media, ignoring the fact that Mr. Trump seemed to use it at every opportunity. The general’s battlefield call sign was “Chaos.”But it was also clear that General Mattis favors a more assertive response to Iran, which he described in a written submission to the Senate committee as the “biggest destabilizing force in the Middle East.”General Mattis did not say how many American troops should be kept in Iraq, but he asserted that the United States needed to maintain its influence there long after Mosul is retaken from the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, to ensure that Iraq “does not become a rump state of the regime in Tehran.”The United States strategy for taking Raqqa, Syria, the capital of the Islamic State, he said, “needs to be reviewed and perhaps energized on a more aggressive timeline.”Some notable Democrats were persuaded by General Mattis’s independent streak, fluency with military issues and repeated promises to uphold the principle of civilian control and consult Congress.Senators Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, and Tim Kaine of Virginia, the former Democratic candidate for vice president and a committee member, were among the lawmakers who voted for a waiver.Three Democrats on the committee voted against amending the law: Senators Kirsten E. Gillibrand of New York, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.Ms. Warren’s vote was somewhat surprising as she devoted her question time to urging General Mattis to consider channeling more military spending to research laboratories in Massachusetts and thanking him for his assurances that he would provide the new president with his candid advice.“Under what circumstances will you advocate for your views forcefully and frankly?” Ms. Warren asked.“On every circumstance, senator,” he replied.“I am very glad to hear that,” she said. “Thank you.”Get politics and Washington news updates via Facebook, Twitter and in the Morning Briefing newsletter.Advertisement
