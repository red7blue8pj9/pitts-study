ChowLouis C.K. will buy back the rights to his film “I Love You, Daddy” after sexual misconduct allegations led to the movie’s shelving.The Orchard, an independent distribution company, bought the film for $5 million after it premiered at the Toronto Film Festival in September to some applause and some revulsion. The movie waded into uncomfortable territory, including sexual predation and public masturbation: “I made a movie that totally walks all over that electric fence,” Louis C.K. said in an interview.But last month, The Times published a report in which five women accused Louis C.K. of sexual misconduct. He confirmed the allegations were true, and the Orchard subsequently suspended its distribution plans.According to Deadline, Louis C.K. will buy the rights to the movie back in full and pay for any additional marketing costs, so that the Orchard will not incur a loss from the movie.There are no current plans for the movie’s distribution. Louis C.K. previously self-released the series “Horace and Pete” on his website.Advertisement
