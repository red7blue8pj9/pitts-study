The country has never had a presidential candidate who lies the way that he does – relentlessly.Yes, virtually every politician, including Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, Mitt Romney and George W. Bush, strays from the truth at times. To be fair, virtually every human being does. But Trump is fundamentally different.His gamble is plain enough: He believes he can fool a lot of the American people a lot of the time. He has decided that lying pays.It’s up to the rest of us to show him otherwise.I invite you to follow me on Twitter (@DLeonhardt) and join me on Facebook.Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTOpinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.
