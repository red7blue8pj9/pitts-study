AdvertisementSupported byContestsBy The Learning NetworkThank you to the 610 teenagers who participated in the very first week of our 10-week Summer Reading Contest, and congratulations to Brian Ham, our winner, as well as to our many runners-up and honorable mentions.Scroll down to take a look at the variety of topics — from space travel to Fortnite, Miss America and North Korea — that caught the eyes of our participants this week.And please remember to always check the top of our contest announcement to find the right place to participate, any week from now until Aug. 24.Brian Ham of Seoul, South Korea, chose an article headlined “The Rich Are Planning to Leave This Wretched Planet” and wrote:What could possibly motivate someone to wear a 180-pound suit with diapers and drink tubes, rotate senselessly in a centrifuge, induce claustrophobia and risk death, all while coughing up 55 million dollars in the process? The answer is right above us: space.For me, space is so alluring because it turns fears into works of art. Despite my thalassophobia, I still find myself attracted to the vast nothingness, the impossible emptiness of the skies. When I’m playing football at sunset on a cloudless night and look up at the infinite sky, I don’t feel distress or panic, even though I realize that I’m just a trivial speck of dust in the galaxy.Philippe Starck, designer of a project aimed to launch millionaires into space, describes it as “a first approach to infinity.” Spending a split nanosecond in the blackness will result in instant death, and yet there’s just something so cozy about drifting in a spaceship with dangers all around but not within, the same coziness one feels snuggling under a blanket while a thunderstorm wages war on the world.All of this is why the article “The Rich Are Planning to Leave This Wretched Planet” attracted me so much. Reading about how my seemingly impossible fantasies could come true was surprisingly relaxing and satisfying. I just have a small problem with the title; space travel shouldn’t be about escaping a miserable world, it should be about discovering and rejoicing in a new one.Alice Vivian Ao on “Where Boys Outperform Girls in Math:Rich, White and Suburban Districts”Dara Armstrong on “A Gay Referee Tries to Find His Place in Hockey”Sruthi Garimella on “Sex and Drugs Decline Among Teens, but Depression and Suicidal Thoughts Grow”Henry Kim on “Struggle With Self-Control?
