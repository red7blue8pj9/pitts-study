I order them whenever I see them in restaurants or on takeout menus, but that does not satisfy the urge often enough.Coming up with a fairly simple recipe that I could whip up at home would mean I could eat them more often — and they would be fresher.The only obstacle was forming each individual dumpling, which seemed like a lot of effort for a weeknight dinner.So instead, I broke the dumpling components down, and reworked them into a multitextured noodle dish. It is brimming with savory meat, silky bok choy and plenty of ginger, and it has the same pungent porky flavors as the dumplings.Admittedly, it’s not the absolute speediest of weeknight dishes. But it still comes together faster than homemade dumplings would, and it’s even quicker than waiting for food to be delivered. Plus, I can vary the ingredients to suit my taste, which in this case means using more vegetables, garlic and ginger and a little less pork. You can do the same, swapping out, say, turkey or chicken for the pork, or kale or Napa cabbage for the bok choy, which is definitely not something you can do at your average takeout spot. Make this dish your own and you’ll probably make it often. I know I have. Recipe: Spicy Ginger Pork Noodles With Bok ChoyWhat’s for Dinner answers that universal question, offering recipes for simple, relatively quick dishes that use ingredients you can pick up on the way home. cookingAdvertisement
