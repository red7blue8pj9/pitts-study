But none of those tasks were as important as writing this newsletter. I know I needed to get this done, but the call of those minor-yet-urgent tasks was too strong.To all of my procrastinators out there, I offer an explanation: Your brain is working against you, and it’s because of a phenomenon called the urgency effect.Our brains tend to prioritize immediate satisfaction over long-term rewards (you probably remember this from the famous marshmallow experiment). But a study from February found that subjects were more likely to perform smaller-but-urgent tasks that had a deadline than they were to perform more important tasks without one. This was true even if the outcome of the smaller task was objectively worse than that of the larger one.“Normatively speaking,” the researchers wrote, “people may choose to perform urgent tasks with short completion windows, instead of important tasks with larger outcomes, because important tasks are more difficult and further away from goal completion, urgent tasks involve more immediate and certain payoffs, or people want to finish the urgent tasks first and then work on important tasks later.”In other words: Even if we know a larger, less-urgent task is vastly more consequential, we will instinctively choose to do a smaller, urgent task anyway. Yet again, thanks for nothing, brain.So what are we to do? To answer that, let’s talk about boxes — specifically, one developed by our 34th president, Dwight D. Eisenhower.Picture a 2x2 square with four boxes. At the top of the square are two labels: Urgent and non-urgent. On the left are two other labels: Important and not important.Here’s a visual (thanks to James Clear, a friend of Smarter Living).[Like what you’re reading?

You’ll quickly see that the things tied to approaching deadlines are quite often not the most important things you have on your plate. Accordingly, schedule time to finish them later or, if possible, delegate them. Similarly, it’s very likely you’ll wind up with tasks that don’t have a deadline and aren’t important. Immediately and aggressively remove them from your to-do list.Two crucial bits I’ll leave you with:If you’re struggling to figure out whether something is important to you, spend some time looking inward to see if it’s truly core to who you are and what your ambitions are.Once you’ve mapped out all of your tasks, embrace the magic of micro-progress and slice them up into tiny goals to make them more manageable.What are your systems for finding out what’s important to you?

Here are strategies for dealing with anxieties and annoyances, large and small. As you probably know, I’m a Twitter obsessive, so I eagerly lapped up this look at “Local Twitter” from Taylor Lorenz, ace tech reporter at The Atlantic.A certain generation remembers the “away status” from our angsty youths — intimate places where we could post inane-yet-personal messages meant more to broadcast a feeling than any particular message, whether that was excitement, heartbreak or simply boredom. (I posted my fair share of lyrics to Brand New when I was feeling particularly emotive.)“Though most users do mainly follow people from their hometowns, local Twitter has more to do with what you tweet than where you live,” Ms. Lorenz writes. “The typical local Twitter user is a teen who is ‘in their own bubble of simple life pleasures and desires,’ doesn’t live their entire life online, ‘and uses Twitter to connect to their real-life friends like they used to do on Facebook,’ explains Raeequaza, a 22-year-old in New York.”Tim Herrera is the founding editor of Smarter Living, where he edits and reports stories about living a better, more fulfilling life.
