The time for the bell ringing has not been released.The 500-pound bell from the church, which was founded by slaves and free blacks in 1776, was restored and is being shipped to the museum for the ceremony by the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation.The church, one of the oldest African-American Baptist churches in the United States, acquired the bell in 1886. Members of an African-American family of four generations are also scheduled to ring the bell at the end of the dedication ceremony.The Rev. Reginald F. Davis, pastor of First Baptist Church, said the tolling would be a symbol of progress made in the pursuit of justice and equality, but a reminder that “we are still pursuing those ideals.”“If we don’t heal from our racial division, our democracy will be undermined,” Mr. Davis said.The bell will return to Williamsburg in October.Advertisement
