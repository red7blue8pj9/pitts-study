Here’s where to find it.Chad Colby is doing some of the best cooking in Los Angeles at Chi Spacca, part of the Mozza restaurant empire. Try porcini-rubbed beef short ribs, tomahawk pork chop and focaccia di Recco, a flaky delight, bubbling with mozzarella. Walk it off the next day. 6610 Melrose Avenue; 323-297-1133; chispacca.com.Petit Trois is a crammed, charming and superhot bar-restaurant by Ludo Lefebvre. Stool seating along the wall and by the open kitchen (sit there). Get the omelet or escargot. Stay late to see Mr. Lefebvre (or Justin Timberlake). No reservations, no cash. 718 North Highland Avenue; 323-468-8916; petittrois.com.Salt’s Cure, a barely marked corner storefront, promises that all food is “locally sourced” and announces its daily dinner menu on its Facebook page in the form of a photograph of the blackboard hanging on one wall of the dining room; with any luck, it will include the avocado and citrus salad and chile pork shoulder. 7494 Santa Monica Boulevard, West Hollywood; 323-850-7258; saltscure.com.Chateau Marmont is Hollywood elegance on Sunset Boulevard, with rooms offering views across Los Angeles. 8221 Sunset Boulevard; 323-656-1010; chateaumarmont.com. Rooms start at $435; the two-bedroom penthouse starts at $4,500 a night.Sunset Tower Hotel shimmers with Hollywood ghosts and history, a buzzing restaurant and lounge, and one of the more glamorous pools around. 8358 Sunset Boulevard, 323-654-7100; sunsettowerhotel.com. Rooms start at $345; the penthouse suite goes for $2,500.It’s beyond touristy, but so what? Hop on the Movie Stars’ Home Tour offered by Star Line Tours. It was surprisingly fun and informative; with the right guide, you’ll be rewarded with a richly detailed history of Hollywood, and take in some envy-producing homes along the way. Star Line Tours; $42 (online); 800-959-3131; starlinetours.com. The trail around the Lake Hollywood Reservoir is a great place for a serene walk or jog, with pristine views of the Hollywood sign, the hills scattered with the occasional home (Madonna lived here once) and, on a clear day, the Pacific. Not to mention deer, coyote, the occasional rattlesnake and actors memorizing their lines. A tidy guide to visiting comes courtesy of Charles Fleming, who writes the L.A. Walks column for The Los Angeles Times.Point Dume State Beach Hollywood is great, but drive to Malibu for one of the most stirring sights around; walk up the cliff (the trail is clearly marked) and along the bluff for views of surfers and sea lions. Spectacular sunsets. Drive there along the Pacific Coast Highway, return on California 23 across the Santa Monica Mountains and pick up U.S. Route 101 back to Los Angeles.Sign up to receive our NYT Living newsletter, a weekly roundup of lifestyle news from the Style, Travel, Food and Home sections delivered to your inbox.Advertisement
