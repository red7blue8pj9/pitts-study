A 2000 production with Johnny Depp was aborted after it was plagued by floods, illnesses and financial issues. Its troubled making supplied the material for a 2002 documentary, “Lost in La Mancha.”After several more starts and stops, the movie went into production again last year with Jonathan Pryce starring as a modern-day man who claims to be Don Quixote and Adam Driver as his would-be Sancho Panza, a cynical TV commercials director. Now the international trailer has been released, but that still doesn’t mean the film is headed to theaters soon. It was reportedly scrapped from this year’s Cannes Film Festival lineup due to legal issues with one of the film’s former producers.Still, the brief clip (with French subtitles) provides the first real evidence that “The Man Who Killed Don Quixote” actually exists. The lavish, surreal visuals and slapstick gags hark back to some of Mr. Gilliam’s earlier farces, like “Monty Python and the Holy Grail” and “Time Bandits.”“The Man Who Killed Don Quixote” has no scheduled release date right now.Advertisement
