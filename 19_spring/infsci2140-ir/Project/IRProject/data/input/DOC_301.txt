Andrew M. Cuomo directed the department to halt the program.“Concerns have been raised by families of inmates regarding the availability and price of products under this program, concerns we do not take lightly,” Thomas Mailey, a department spokesman, said in a statement, adding that the pilot program, which was introduced in three prisons, would be suspended until the concerns were addressed.“In the meantime, we will redouble our efforts on the other parts of our multifaceted plan to eliminate contraband and increase safety in our prison system.”Advocates had worried the program would force the inmates’ families, many of whom are of limited means, to choose between visiting their loved ones and sending care packages. They pointed out that several of the vendors’ catalogs advertised inflated prices for popular goods such as Oreo cookies or plain T-shirts, which many family members had previously bought in bulk or at local stores.The ban on used books drew special ire, especially from groups that donated reading material to inmates in hopes of easing their re-entry into society.Advocates praised the decision but said they hoped to see the program abandoned completely.“I don’t know if this is going to be a permanent end to this idea, or if we’ll see it reincarnated in different form in the not-too-distant future,” Soffiyah Elijah, executive director of Alliance of Families for Justice, said.The group had helped organize a postcard-writing campaign to Mr. Cuomo and the corrections department’s acting commissioner, Anthony J. Annucci, asking them to reconsider the policy.“For now, we will cautiously celebrate, but be ever vigilant and watchful as to what else might come,” Ms. Elijah said.Follow Vivian Wang on Twitter: @vwang3.OpinionTariro MzezewaAdvertisement
