Across the country, at least two dozen women have been attacked in recent years after making a similar mistake. [Read about women being attacked by men posing as drivers.]Asking that simple question — “What’s my name?” — would help keep riders safe, advocates said. Here are more tips for what you can do, according to law enforcement officials and ride-share companies:After booking a ride, a confirmation text should include the license plate number and a description of the car. It is critical to know what you are getting.Depending on the tier of service you choose, Uber could send anything from a basic four-door sedan to a black sport-utility vehicle that is commercially registered and insured. A vehicle that is not what you expect is one of the more obvious giveaways that there might be a problem. Any discrepancy is a red flag, and riders should not get into the car. That confirmation message from the ride-share app should also include a photo of your driver, so check to be sure they match. Always ask the driver their name and make sure that it also lines up. Share your trip details with a friend, relative or a group through the sharing option available on the app. By adding your destination and sharing through a text, others can watch your ride, in real time, on a map. The “Trusted Contacts” feature allows you to select up to five friends or family members with whom you can share your whereabouts for every ride.Uber and Via monitor drivers’ routes, sending alerts to their staff if the cars go off course. Riders with Lyft can also share the route and estimated time of arrival by tapping Send ETA.Uber and Lyft also offer glowing dashboard lights called the Beacon and Amp that change color to match a hue on a passenger’s app. But the lights are in limited distribution and not available to all drivers. Lawmakers in South Carolina have proposed a law, named for Ms. Josephson, that would require all ride-share drivers to display a lighted sign. If you suspect danger, or if you have an emergency, call 911 immediately. Uber also provides an in-app emergency button to connect riders directly to 911. It can be reached through a section of the app called the Safety Center.Advertisement
