Hirsch:Boston has four infamous hills between 16 and 21 miles, just where you don’t need them. The last is the dreaded Heartbreak Hill. I trudged up the first three, fearful about Heartbreak just ahead.Then I was on it, leaning steeply into the slope. Near the top, I heard a police officer on a bullhorn exhorting the runners. Suddenly, he was speaking directly to me: “No. 622, at the crest of the hill, you have five miles to go, and it’s all downhill.”I’ll never forget his next words: “Your achievement is superb and you have my fullest admiration.”I knew then that I would finish the Boston Marathon. And tears welled up in my eyes._________The Word of the Day and the quiz question have been provided by Vocabulary.com.
