We share coverage of historic events — the world wars, the women’s suffrage movement, the great expeditions — and we republish glimpses of less earthshaking moments and the ephemera of daily life. The same stories that caught the eyes of our generations of editors now offer us insight into the lives and interests of generations of Trib readers.James Gordon Bennett Jr. was a flashy socialite who took over The New York Herald from his father in the 1860s. Though he inherited the business, he felt strongly about the paper and invested a great deal of money in it. After moving to Paris, he opened the European edition of The Herald in 1887. The paper found its niche, later morphed into The International Herald Tribune and celebrated its 125th birthday in 2012.As The IHT’s rich archive has become available online, these posts have offered stories of sensational murders, corruption scandals and outrageous fashions — not to mention tales of pets, socialites and globe-trotters — alongside international news stories that made headlines around the world.Above all, here you can catch a glimpse of history as seen through the eyes of a venerable newspaper whose legacy lives on through The International New York Times — and this collection.Enjoy a peek into our past.Advertisement
