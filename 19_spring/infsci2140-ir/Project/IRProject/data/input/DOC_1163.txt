Biden Jr. said from the Rose Garden on Wednesday, invoking his late son, felled by cancer, before a long pause.“Beau is our inspiration.”It was occasionally rambling.“I would have wanted to have been the president,” he said, “that ended cancer, because it’s possible.”It was strikingly familial, even paternal.“Go back to your old neighborhoods,” he implored the reporters assembled in front of him. See the country’s inequities for yourself, he urged. “Talk to your contemporaries who aren’t as successful as you’ve been.”In its excesses, self-reflection and emotion, Mr. Biden’s 13-minute farewell to presidential politics on Wednesday was the distillation of the unvarnished campaign that many Democrats desperately wanted and the vice president declined to give them.He was unabashedly populist, ticking off the names of middle- and working-class areas like Mayfield, Del., and Willow Grove, Pa.With a mix of pride and defensiveness, he recalled one of his nicknames, “Middle-Class Joe.”“I know in Washington that’s not really meant a compliment; it means you’re not that sophisticated,” said the man who once lived by the Amtrak schedule that delivered him from Wilmington to Washington, linking himself to those who have never quite felt they belonged to the elite.His speech was strikingly informal, adopting the familiar tone of the kitchen table (or the neighborhood bar) that has defined his colorful, at times profane, tenure as vice president.“Honey, it’s gonna be O.K.,” he said repeatedly, deploying his favorite term of endearment.And there were flashes of ego, as when he envisioned a glorious role for himself in cracking the code on cancer. “I believe that we need a moon shot in this country to cure cancer,” he said. “It’s personal.”Above all, he sounded nostalgic for the campaign that was not to be.“Unfortunately, I believe we’re out of time,” he said, the regret on his face and in his voice. “The time necessary to mount a winning campaign for the nomination.”“But,” he added, with a touch of trademark Biden mischief, “while I will not be a candidate, I will not be silent.”Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.videoAdvertisement
