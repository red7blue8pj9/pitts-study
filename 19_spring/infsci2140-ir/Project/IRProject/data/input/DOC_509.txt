In 2000, that figure was 10 percent, and in 1981 it was just 8 percent. The ever-increasing cost of housing is an obvious factor, but it may not be the only one. A recent analysis by the LendingTree MoneyMatters blog ranked the 50 largest American metropolitan areas according to the percentage of a wider range of adults living with their parents: those between 25 and 40. And higher real estate prices did not necessarily correlate with the trend.In Riverside, Calif., where the median sale price of a single-family home in 2018 was $360,000, 28 percent of adults between 25 and 40 were living with their parents — making it No. 1 on the list. But in Seattle, where the median home sale price was a much higher $501,400, 12 percent of those between 25 and 40 were living with their parents, putting it at the bottom of the list.More significant than housing prices may be the unemployment rate for that age group: In January, it averaged 8.6 percent, compared to 3.7 percent for the adult population overall, in these metropolitan areas.
