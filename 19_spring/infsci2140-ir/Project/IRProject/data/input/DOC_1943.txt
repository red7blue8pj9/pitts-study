This year, it’s a featured drink, spiked with vodka, at Dallas BBQ restaurants.At Ralph Lauren’s Polo Bar in Manhattan, Darnell Dodson, the beverage director, has devised the Rosé Royale, which he calls “summer in a glass.” It is the restaurant’s best-selling summer cocktail and is also served at Mr. Lauren’s restaurants in Paris, London and Chicago.It incorporates bittersweet French grapefruit liqueur, also called pamplemousse, which beautifully enhances the flavor and aroma of a rosé, and an orange spirit called Royal Combier, which Mr. Dodson describes as similar to Grand Marnier though not as sweet. “For the wine, I use a classic Provençal rosé for the acidity,” he said.Advice for camp cooking, picnics and potlucks, along with recipes, cocktails, frozen desserts and a taste-test of the best supermarket hot dogs.An assertive rosé of gamay plays the lead role in City of Rosés, a sleek cocktail at Jackrabbit, a restaurant in the Duniway, a new Hilton hotel in Portland, Ore. Blanc vermouth and Cynar, the artichoke liqueur, round out the wine with alluring herbal notes.Rosé has also become a base for sangria. At the Fontainebleau in Miami Beach, sweet orange and cassis liqueurs are mixed with the wine and fresh fruit in the hotel’s La Côte bistro.Wölffer Kitchen in Sag Harbor, N.Y., serves a pink sangria made with rosé from its own vineyard, Wölffer Estate, in nearby Sagaponack. It’s fresh and flavorful, and because it’s not particularly sweet, complements dishes like salmon tartare, grilled calamari and wood-roasted shrimp.Recipes: City of Rosés | Sagaponack Sangria | Rosé RoyaleFollow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.
