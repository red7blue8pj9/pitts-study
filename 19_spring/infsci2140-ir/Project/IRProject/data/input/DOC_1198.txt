In this scene from “A Star Is Born,” two people who just met sit outside a grocery store late at night and chat. One of them just happens to be a famous rock star (Jackson Maine, played by Bradley Cooper). The other, Ally (Lady Gaga), comes up with a lyric on the fly to describe the star she’s getting to know. But in singing that lyric, she proves that she might have talent herself.In the video’s narration, Cooper, who also directed the film, discusses how he set up the burgeoning relationship between these two characters (making the scene feel like it was unfolding in real time) and why it takes place at a grocery store (his fascination, before he himself was famous, with the fact that celebrities also go to the store sometimes).“The movie knows she’s a star before she does,” Cooper said. So when she sings her just-created lyrics for what will become one of the movie’s biggest songs, “Shallow,” the camera frames her as if the parking lot she’s in is a giant stage, and Jackson one of her adoring fans.Read the Critic’s Pick review of “A Star Is Born.”Read a profile of Bradley Cooper.Read a profile of Lady Gaga.Sign up for the Movies Update newsletter and get a roundup of reviews, news, Critics’ Picks and more.Mekado Murphy is a senior staff editor with a focus on movies coverage.
