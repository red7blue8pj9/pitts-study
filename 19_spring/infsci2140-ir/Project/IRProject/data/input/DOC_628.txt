He said the eight-year-old restaurant was not doing enough consistent business throughout the week to justify keeping it open.“In this location, it’s busy on weekends but erratic in the early part of the week,” he said.The restaurant, a large, informal room with an open kitchen, specializes in beer, sausages and rustic country food. The décor features shelves filled with cookware, like copper pots, once owned by famous chefs, including Paul Bocuse. Mr. Boulud plans to relocate the staff. The chef, Nicholas Tang, will go to the DBGB in Washington. Mr. Boulud said he would also like to reopen the restaurant in another location.“I hope to find a more appropriate space for it in New York,” Mr. Boulud said.DBGB Kitchen and Bar, 299 Bowery (Houston Street), 212-933-5300, dbgb.com.Advertisement
