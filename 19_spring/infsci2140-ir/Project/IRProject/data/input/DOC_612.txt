But the melting pot image belies the reality that much of the city remains divided along racial or ethnic lines. In dozens of neighborhoods, a single racial or ethnic group predominates, at rates of 70 percent to nearly 90 percent in areas like Washington Heights in Manhattan, Tottenville on Staten Island and East Flatbush in Brooklyn.The New York Times asked residents in community districts that were highly divided along racial and ethnic lines to describe what they liked and didn’t like about their neighborhoods.“We’re in the subway, we’re interacting with a lot of different people,” said Ingrid Gould Ellen, a segregation expert and faculty director of New York University’s Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy. “It feels more racially integrated than it actually is.”With his pledge to build 80,000 affordable units over 10 years, Mayor Bill de Blasio has a chance to alter racial housing patterns, not just to reshape the market.But integrating neighborhoods is a complicated undertaking. In New York, it has put housing advocates at odds with civil rights defenders in a way that places pressure on Mr. de Blasio, a liberal Democrat who considers himself an ally of both.There are difficult trade-offs to grapple with. Redeveloping low-income areas can increase diversity by bringing in higher-income residents. But it can also end up pricing out existing residents. Doing the reverse — investing in affordable housing in more expensive areas — can draw in low-income residents. But government subsidies often do not go as far in such neighborhoods, with the potential result that fewer rental units are priced at affordable rates.Diversifying the demographic makeup of neighborhoods can also, in some cases, dilute the political clout of ethnic or racial groups.These tensions have been on display in the battles over the de Blasio administration’s efforts to rezone lower-income neighborhoods to build both market-rate and below-market-rate units. Housing advocates have pushed for more city-subsidized apartments for the poorest of households to be set aside in the East New York section of Brooklyn, the first area targeted for redevelopment. Their fear: that the higher rents that often follow development will lead to a so-called whitening of a neighborhood that is mostly black and Latino.One way the city already tries to ensure that existing residents remain in areas being rezoned is through a “community preferences” policy, which allots as many as half of new lower-cost units to applicants already living in the area where such units are being built.But a fair-housing group, the Anti-Discrimination Center, challenged that policy in a federal lawsuit last year, contending that it perpetuates segregation. In the case of mostly white districts, the center contended, the preferences deny black and Latino New Yorkers an equal chance for a home in better neighborhoods.“‘Stay off our turf’ — that’s not a winning strategy,” said Craig Gurian, executive director of the center, which won a landmark desegregation settlement with Westchester County in 2009. “There’s not a good kind of segregation.”Over all, no one racial group makes up more than a third of the city’s population, and some neighborhoods have become more mixed in recent decades. Yet, as the de Blasio administration’s housing plan acknowledges, nearly half of the city’s 59 community districts, whose boards advise elected officials, are dominated by a single racial or ethnic bloc. Community districts with nonwhite majorities tend also to be the most disadvantaged, census figures and research show, with lower levels of educational attainment and higher rates of poverty and crime.Mr. de Blasio, asked during a February meeting at The New York Times how much he prioritized integration as he pursued his housing goals, said he believed it was “a really important area of public policy and one where we need more and better tools.”The city recently began tackling segregation in schools, another byproduct of housing segregation, through a pilot program meant to diversify student bodies.Vicki Been, commissioner of the city’s Department of Housing Preservation and Development, said the administration’s affordable housing strategy aimed to bring a range of household incomes to both “sought after” neighborhoods and poorer ones.Ms. Been also cited the construction of mixed-income buildings, financed through a combination of city, state and federal money, as well as the opening up of more housing choices for recipients of Section 8, the federal rental-assistance program, as effective integration tools.“With economic diversity comes racial diversity,” Ms. Been said.The cost of housing in the city poses an obstacle. Section 8 vouchers are meant to give renters a choice of neighborhoods to live in, but the voucher amounts are too low in most cases to pay for housing in anywhere other than lower-income areas. Similarly, affordable housing financed by the city is usually concentrated in parts of the city with higher-than-average poverty rates, where land is cheaper, Furman Center research shows.The city recently adopted a mandatory inclusionary housing policy that requires developers to set aside up to 30 percent of all units in new market-rate buildings for lower-rent apartments if they want to build in neighborhoods rezoned for new residential development.The first eight areas where the new policy applies are mostly minority neighborhoods with household incomes below the citywide median. Officials said they considered factors like which areas could accommodate growth, and had undervalued land.Though officials said the policy would eventually be applied to other neighborhoods, some critics say that the city should have included more affluent areas sooner as part of a broader fair-housing strategy.“It’s fair to say that some people are questioning why the first neighborhoods are low-income communities,” said City Councilman Brad Lander, a Brooklyn Democrat and an ally of the mayor who says he wants more affordable housing in the Gowanus section in his district.There are worries about the opposite approach as well, with some affordable-housing advocates suggesting that investing in higher-income areas could lead to the neglect of poorer ones.“There’s a significant amount of anxiety over the objections that seem to discourage investment in communities of poverty,” Mathew M. Wambua, the housing commissioner under Mr. de Blasio’s predecessor, Michael R. Bloomberg, said at a fair-housing panel last fall. “The fear is the idea of undermining investment in communities rich in culture, vibrancy and resilience.”The challenge, from the perspective of housing advocates, is how to protect low-income residents from displacement as neighborhoods improve and market-rent newcomers drive up housing costs.In 2014, community groups in Downtown Brooklyn, citing gentrification concerns, won an accelerated schedule for the Atlantic Yards megaproject, whose developers had initially pledged to create 2,250 affordable apartments by 2035. By then, the groups argued, the black population would have dropped to 15 percent from 40 percent, according to demographic projections, which showed the number of white people almost doubling over the same period. The groups said soaring rents would force most low-income tenants out of the area, denying them a shot at the new units.The community groups, which support preferences for local residents in housing lotteries, succeeded in securing promises that the units would be finished 10 years earlier.“The issue of community preference cuts both ways and an argument can clearly be made in certain neighborhoods, at varying stages of neighborhood change, that a community preference does in fact promote fair housing,” said Michelle de la Uz, a member of the city’s Planning Commission and executive director of Fifth Avenue Committee, a nonprofit developer in Brooklyn.City officials say the key to holding displacement at bay while building mixed-income communities is to do more both to preserve existing rent-regulated units and to monitor harassment by landlords who illegally evict tenants to take advantage of rising rents in gentrifying areas.Some say it also helps to take a long view.“We need to be willing to look at the big picture and not at a neighborhood at a time,” said Xavier de Souza Briggs, a Ford Foundation vice president and author specializing on economic opportunity and segregation. “If we choose to fight for affordability only, one neighborhood at a time, that would trade away inclusion. It tends to perpetuate that segregated geography.”Advertisement
