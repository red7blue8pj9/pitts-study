He worked at Per Se and she at Buddakan before they opened a ramen pop-up that gained a big following. Last March, Pete Wells of The New York Times wrote that when he “made a list of my favorite bowls of ramen in the city, I put it in first place.” The new Mu Ramen, brick-walled with smart dark-wood finishes, has an open kitchen and 22 seats at the counter and a communal table. The cooks double as waiters. “I have enough cooks to do that,” Mr. Smookler said. “I like the personal interaction you get at sushi bars.” The menu from the husband-and-wife team offers tebasaki gyoza (fried chicken wings stuffed with brioche and foie gras) and four or so ramen bowls, each with custom-tailored noodles.
