We offered guidelines, a rubric and a related lesson plan, but, honestly, we had no idea what would result.We should have relaxed, however, because what we got was wonderful.The 675 submissions that came in showed us the range of possibilities offered by audio. Students played with formats, some featuring spirited conversations, others vox pop interviews, personal monologues or investigative reporting, but all used the power of sound — the human voice, music, environmental noise, clips from other media sources — to compel us.The topics students selected ran the gamut, from the N.B.A. playoffs and Fortnite to gun violence, family relationships and teenage depression. Some students even performed fictional audio stories.As we judged, we also admired the way teachers took full advantage of the open-ended nature of the contest to make podcasting work for their purposes. Science teachers assigned classes to explore topics like climate change and genetics, social studies teachers encouraged students to examine the meaning of global citizenship and how history affects their lives, and journalism teachers suggested that students tell a story through interviews.Below we showcase the work of 10 winners. Listen and notice how they entertain, inform and use their limited time skillfully: These podcasts pulled us in right from the start and kept our attention to the end. And if you’d like to hear even more excellent work, you can scroll down to access the podcasts created by our runners-up and honorable mentions. Each list is in alphabetical order by title.Since this was our inaugural foray into podcasting, we’d love to hear from you about how we might improve the challenge for next year.
