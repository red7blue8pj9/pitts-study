AdvertisementSupported byBy Ben KenigsbergIt may be time to retire the type of road movie in which the protagonist, ostensibly on an urgent journey, insists on taking back roads — partly because she doesn’t like trucks, she says, but really because a quick drive on the Interstate wouldn’t sustain a feature.A case of excellent actors’ straining to elevate a contrived screenplay, “Strange Weather,” directed by Katherine Dieckmann (the atmospheric “Diggers”), casts Holly Hunter as Darcy, an academic administrator, at a university in Georgia. Darcy is at a crossroads: Applying for a belated bachelor’s degree, she may soon lose her job to budget cuts. Her son, Walker, committed suicide seven years earlier.Darcy soon learns that Mark (Shane Jacobsen), a friend of Walker’s, has grown wealthy after founding a chain of hot dog restaurants — Walker’s idea. Conspiring to confront Mark in New Orleans, she brings along her friend Byrd (Carrie Coon) and the gun Walker used to kill himself, probably more for symbolism than for proving Chekhov’s axiom.The journey is a pretext for healing, as Darcy visits an old friend (Glenne Headly, who died in June) and Walker’s father (Ted Ferguson), who abused her but is now ailing and mute. This gives Darcy a chance to unburden her thoughts to him while allowing Ms. Dieckmann, who wrote the screenplay, to avoid the complications of constructing a conversation.That’s the movie in a nutshell: A catharsis more meaningful for the character than for her audience.Movie data powered by IMDb.comRated R for sex and grief. Running time: 1 hour 32 minutes.Advertisement
