The spirits company has taken that name for its latest product, its first that’s not a vodka. The brandy is a blend of French and California spirits, aged in charred whiskey barrels. It has a floral bouquet and takes flight on the palate, with honey, vanilla and golden raisin notes. As brandies go, it’s more delicate than bold.Bentwing Brandy $32, hangarone.com.Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest.
