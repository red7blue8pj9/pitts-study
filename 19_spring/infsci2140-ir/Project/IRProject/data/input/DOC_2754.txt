Shear and Eric SchmittWASHINGTON — Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, resigned on Sunday after meeting with President Trump, ending a tumultuous tenure in charge of the border security agency that had made her the target of the president’s criticism.“I have determined that it is the right time for me to step aside,” Ms. Nielsen said in a resignation letter. “I hope that the next secretary will have the support of Congress and the courts in fixing the laws which have impeded our ability to fully secure America’s borders and which have contributed to discord in our nation’s discourse.”Ms. Nielsen had requested the meeting to plan “a way forward” at the border, in part thinking she could have a reasoned conversation with Mr. Trump about the role, according to three people familiar with the meeting. She came prepared with a list of things that needed to change to improve the relationship with the president.Mr. Trump in recent weeks had asked Ms. Nielsen to close the ports of entry along the border and to stop accepting asylum seekers, which Ms. Nielsen found ineffective and inappropriate. While the 30-minute meeting was cordial, Mr. Trump was determined to ask for her resignation. After the meeting, she submitted it.transcriptHosted by Michael Barbaro, produced by Rachel Quester, Jessica Cheung and Eric Krupke, and edited by Paige CowettAs homeland security secretary, she enacted and publicly defended the family separation policy. In President Trump’s eyes, she didn’t go far enough.michael barbaroFrom The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today: The secretary of homeland security was forced out of her job, even after carrying out and defending President Trump’s most restrictive immigration policies. Why that wasn’t enough. It’s Tuesday, April 9. Caitlin, describe what happened over the weekend.caitlin dickersonSo on Sunday, Kirstjen Nielsen, who’s the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security — she’s the nation’s highest-ranking immigration officer — she goes to the White House for an unscheduled meeting with President Trump.michael barbaroCaitlin Dickerson covers immigration for The Times.caitlin dickersonAnd he, in recent weeks, has been very riled up publicly over an increasing number of people crossing the border, especially families who seek asylum who have legal protections that mean they have to be allowed into the country. So the secretary arrives at her meeting with a list of ideas for how to address this problem, and she thinks she and the president are going to come up with a way forward. But instead, a few hours later, the president sends a tweet announcing that she will be leaving her job.archived recording 1Breaking news here on CNN. From the White House, the secretary of homeland security, Kirstjen Nielsen, has resigned.archived recording 2President Trump made the announcement via Twitter.archived recording 3In a tweet, the president said, quote, “Secretary of homeland security Kirstjen Nielsen will be leaving her position, and I would like to thank her for her service.”archived recording 4So it appears that the president is swinging the revolving door yet again, trying to install new people in his administration to carry out his bidding.michael barbaroThat sounds like a meeting that went very poorly for the secretary.caitlin dickersonClearly, they were not able to come up with a solution that both could agree on.michael barbaroAnd by tweeting her resignation, I think what we’re politely suggesting is that he fired her.caitlin dickersonFired her. Yes, exactly.michael barbaroSo what is the history between President Trump and Secretary Nielsen?caitlin dickersonSo Secretary Nielsen takes her job at the end of 2017. She’s replacing her former boss, John Kelly, who went to be President Trump’s chief of staff. And she takes on this role as basically the person who has to approve any new policy that’s going to be introduced along the border. And it’s at this period of time when, I think, the President is settling into his role. He’s fired up about really coming up with some hard evidence that he can point to ahead of the midterm elections, for example, and say, look, I’m keeping my campaign promises, and I’m lowering immigration really dramatically. So right away, she’s faced with aggressive ideas for how to prevent people from coming to the United States, and the first one is family separation.michael barbaroAnd what do we know about how Nielsen responds to that very controversial policy when it is first introduced to her?caitlin dickersonShe slow-walks it. We reported in December of 2017 that a family separation policy had reached her desk for that final signature, and it took her four months to approve it, during which time she and President Trump clashed quite a bit. She had questions about the legality of it. She had questions about the practicality and how the public was going to respond. And she had just a lot of reservations about moving forward. But ultimately, she agreed, and the policy was introduced in a formal way in April.archived recording 1Quit separating the kids! They’re separating the children. Mr. President, don’t you have kids? Don’t you have kids, Mr. President?archived recording 2I don’t believe in this. This is not America. This is not our country. This is not what we should be doing.archived recording (kirstjen nielsen)This administration did not create a policy of separating families at the border.archived recordingShame on everybody that separates children and allows them to stay at the other side of the border, fearing death, and allow the secretary to come here and lie.archived recording (kirstjen nielsen)Calling me a liar are fighting words. I’m not a liar. We’ve never had a policy for family separation. And let’s be clear — if an American were to commit a crime anywhere in the United States, they would go to jail, and they would be separated from their family. This is not a controversial idea.caitlin dickersonInternally, she’s, if not resisting, she’s certainly questioning and slowing down a lot of these policies. And then, externally, to the public, she’s having to defend them and really look like the face of them, and that ends up being something that she does actually over and over again in her job.michael barbaroAnd remind us what ends up happening to the family separation policy.caitlin dickersonSo President Trump stopped the practice himself by signing an executive order.archived recording (donald trump)I consider it to be a very important executive order. It’s about keeping families together.caitlin dickersonBut it didn’t matter, because a few days later, a federal judge intervened, deemed the practice unconstitutional, and he didn’t stop there. He said that —archived recordingFamilies who have been separated as a result of the Trump administration’s zero-tolerance policy be reunited within 30 days. The order says kids under 5 must be back with their parents within 14 days from now.caitlin dickersonSo sort of a resounding disavowal of this policy.michael barbaroBy the legal system.caitlin dickersonExactly. And so even though she’d pushed back against it, Secretary Nielsen ends up taking the blame.michael barbaroSo what’s another example something that she expresses internal qualms about but then goes out and defends publicly?caitlin dickersonSo one of the next policies to be introduced was an idea to limit asylum pretty significantly so that people could only apply if they showed up at a legal port of entry — whereas beforehand, people could and did very often show up anywhere along the border, present themselves to a border agency, ask for protection, and they were ushered into this legal process. The idea was to say, you can’t do that anymore. You have to show up at a specific office, which is, of course, a pretty tall order for somebody who’s coming from Central America with maybe a cell phone, maybe not, not a whole lot of resources. They don’t always know exactly where these offices exist.archived recording (kirstjen nielsen)You do not need to break the law of this country by entering illegally to claim asylum. If you are seeking asylum, go to a port of entry.caitlin dickersonBut as Nielsen pointed out to the president, it was very hard to justify, because immigration law explicitly says that you can request asylum regardless of where you enter.michael barbaroSo again, Nielsen is saying inside the White House, hey, this might not be legal. I have reservations about it. But it nevertheless gets implemented. And as you’ve said, she’s the decider. So she signs off on it.caitlin dickersonExactly. And it’s important to point out that when Nielsen pushed back against President Trump, it wasn’t a reflection of her being a liberal on immigration or having a more sympathetic view toward asylum seekers. She just happened to be the face of an entire agency full of people who work in immigration enforcement but who still made clear to her that there were going to be legal and logistical roadblocks to putting these ideas into place.michael barbaroAnd what happens to that port of entry policy that would limit the number of locations that people can apply for asylum?caitlin dickersonVery quickly after, it’s blocked by federal courts, and it remains that way.archived recordingA district court ruled that the ban conflicts with immigration law.caitlin dickersonSo this was the executive branch trying to very clearly contradict laws that were approved by the legislative branch.archived recordingAnd now the Supreme Court has refused to step in to unblock the ban.michael barbaroSo her legal reservations are well-founded. In other words, her advice to the president is correct, even if it’s ignored.caitlin dickersonThat’s right. Her analysis is sound, because each time she is pushed back, she’s been right. And these ideas have been blocked.michael barbaroDo any of these policies that we’re describing — family separation, limiting the locations at which people can seek asylum — do any of them succeed in curbing the flow of migrants, even for the very short period of time that they’re in place before they are legally challenged?caitlin dickersonThey don’t.archived recordingNew numbers show a 400 percent — 4-0-0, that is — 400 percent increase over just last year.caitlin dickersonLast October, we saw a record number of families seek asylum in the United States. This is after family separation is introduced. And every month since then, the numbers have gotten even higher.archived recordingC.B.P. officials say Border Patrol agents are on pace for apprehensions and encounters with more than 100,000 migrants in March.michael barbaroSo not only are these policies being blocked in court, for the very short bit of time that they were ever in place, they’re not doing their job of limiting the flow of migrants.caitlin dickersonThey’re not. The numbers keep going up. And some people would argue that maybe the policies weren’t left in place for long enough to show any concrete outcome, and we can’t know that for sure. But what we do know is that these policies that Nielsen was pushing back on, saying they’re not going to work, didn’t work. And the numbers have continued to rise.michael barbaroAnd so what does that do to the president’s relationship to Nielsen? She’s in a sense being vindicated, but the problem she’s there to solve is only getting worse.caitlin dickersonShe’s simultaneously sort of being vindicated if you look at it from a legal standpoint, but from a relationship standpoint, she’s the face, in President Trump’s eyes, of these failures.archived recording 1Kirstjen Nielsen appears to be on shaky ground. That’s according to a New York Times report. Nielsen told colleagues that she was close to resigning Wednesday after being berated by the president in front of the entire cabinet.archived recording 2Nothing sets him off more than immigration, and I’m told that meeting on Wednesday in the cabinet room was very heated, was incredibly heated. She spoke back to him about it, tried to defend herself.caitlin dickersonSo it’s in this context of the policies that are being introduced being blocked in the courts, the number of people crossing the border rising, and Trump’s relationship with Secretary Nielsen falling apart that he comes up with his most aggressive idea yet.archived recordingAnother day, another threat from President Trump, and today, he is threatening to shut down the southern border.caitlin dickersonWhere he wants to completely seal the border, 100 percent. Not let anybody come into the U.S.archived recording (donald trump)And if they don’t stop them, we’re closing the border. We’ll close it, and we’ll keep it closed for a long time. I’m not playing games.michael barbaroAnd how exactly would that work?caitlin dickersonWell, we shouldn’t assume that the president had any particular policy in his mind when he tweeted that he wanted to seal the border. We can assume, though, that he wasn’t talking about, for example, cargo moving back and forth or people with actual visas and permission to come into the United States, but really that he’s talking about shutting down asylum and shutting down the ability of people who don’t previously have permission to come into the United States. And the policy that we know has come closest to achieving that goal, one that’s been kicking around in Washington for some months now, would be to get rid of asylum as we know it. It would no longer allow anyone to apply for asylum in the United States. And instead, people who needed that status or wanted that status would have to stay in their home country, similar to the way that Syrian refugees apply to come to the United States — apply from home, wait many months, go through lots of vetting and background checks, and then only if they’re approved, they would be allowed to come here.michael barbaroAnd I guess, what could be a more extreme version of limiting asylum than literally telling people, you cannot come to this country and apply for asylum?caitlin dickersonI don’t think there is a more extreme version, because I think this idea means eliminating asylum. It goes away.michael barbaroAnd as best we understand it, what was Secretary Nielsen’s response to this idea?caitlin dickersonFrom what we know, it’s been very similar to the way she reacted to family separation, to that idea to significantly limit asylum to the ports of entry, which is that this is going to be challenged by the courts immediately. It’s going to be a huge lift to get a policy like this introduced, to work out the logistics, and all of it will be for naught, because it’ll be enjoined by the courts. And it’s that oppositional and resistant stance that she’s in when she walks into the White House for her meeting with the president. It’s unclear who threw up their hands first or second, or whether they both did it, but what we know is that the president did not leave her with an option, that he, at least, decided this isn’t going to work. You’re out. And she was by the end of that night. And so what that means is the homeland security secretary who oversaw some of the most controversial and aggressive immigration policies this country has ever seen — even she wasn’t aggressive enough for President Trump. And so now she’s gone, and he’s looking for a replacement who will go even further.michael barbaroWe’ll be right back. So Caitlin, who is the president turning to to replace Nielsen as he looks for somebody to go further than she was willing to go?caitlin dickersonHe’s turning to Kevin McAleenan, who’s currently the head of United States Customs and Border Protection. That’s the agency that oversees both the customs officers who you meet at the airport when you’ve gone on vacation abroad and then the Border Patrol. Those are the police, the boots on the ground along the border. And McAleenan is known as sort of a policy wonk, a really smart and reasonable guy who’s willing to work with Democrats, and somebody who served under President Obama as well. He’s got more than 10 years of experience at the agency. People know him as this reasonable guy. But when you dig a little bit deeper, McAleenan was inspired to get into homeland security work right after 9/11. And at C.B.P., especially most recently when he was overseeing this agency, it really became known as the sort of policy engine with him at the center of it coming up with ways to turn President Trump’s ideas into actual policies that could be carried out. If D.H.S. is this agency run out of Washington that’s overseeing all of this work, it was McAleenan’s staff members that were actually physically taking children away from their parents, that were physically turning asylum seekers away at the border or telling them to go elsewhere or to wait in line. So now he’s moving into this role where he’s got even more power, but I think we can expect that he’ll continue to do what he was doing before, which was take President Trump’s ideas that are sort of extreme and that aren’t necessarily encumbered by the immigration laws, norms, history, and he’ll try to translate them into something that’s practical and that can be introduced on the ground.michael barbaroSo even though he might seem moderate at first glance, he’s actually someone who the president trusts to put these more restrictive, maybe even extreme policies into practice. And he’s been involved in doing that already. Now he’s being elevated to do it at an even higher level.caitlin dickersonExactly.michael barbaroAnd I guess that all makes sense. If Nielsen is seen as too reluctant to put these policies into practice, then the president would turn to somebody who is willing to do that.caitlin dickersonThat’s right, who is willing to try. But remember that McAleenan is going to run up against the exact same legal framework and logistical challenges that anybody else in that role is going to.michael barbaroRight. So if these policies are going to run into legal trouble in the courts, regardless of who is leading the agency, what does it matter, in the end, if the leader of the Department of Homeland Security is gung-ho about the President’s policies or is reluctantly saying yes, as Nielsen was?caitlin dickersonI think you can look at that question a couple of different ways. On one hand, you’re right that it’s not going to make a huge difference who’s sitting in the office at the head of the Homeland Security Department, because no matter what they introduce, if it violates the immigration law, they’re going to wind up in court. But another way of looking at it is family separation only existed as an official sort of policy for what, 45 days under zero tolerance? Not a very long period of time before it had to end. But still, I don’t think that very many people are going to argue that family separation was a small thing or something that didn’t affect very many people. I mean, I think it had a huge impact. So I do think that if you have a hawk running the Homeland Security Department, even when they’re sort of encumbered by the existing legal framework, they can make some pretty big changes, even if, ultimately, those changes wind up in court. I think that Kevin McAleenan has two things going for him in President Trump’s eyes. The first, like we said, is that he knows the policies and he knows the situation on the ground like the back of his hand. And the second thing is that he’s shown a willingness to follow President Trump’s lead, and so he may be the person who’s best positioned to come up with the most legal ways to achieve President Trump’s goals. And even if the policies that he comes up with don’t remain in place in the long term, they might at least exist long enough to give President Trump something to point to and show his supporters when they ask, where are you on these campaign promises? Where are you on this idea of, if not sealing the border, significantly decreasing the number of immigrants coming to the United States?michael barbaroSo even if these policies are ultimately blocked by the courts, it feels like it’s important to this president to have someone at the Department of Homeland Security who is willing to try them, and that may be enough.caitlin dickersonI think in President Trump’s heart of hearts, right, he would hope that he would find not only somebody who is willing to try but somebody who is going to succeed. He wants aggressive policies to be instituted in the long term. But I think it’s better in his mind than nothing to have somebody who’s willing to try. And as we know, politically, it’s better than nothing, because then the president can point to these policies that he tried to introduce, if only it wasn’t for the courts who had blocked him, or if only it wasn’t for Congress who blocked him.michael barbaroRight. My intention was there. Somebody else is at fault for it not working.caitlin dickersonExactly. He has at least an attempt to meet these campaign promises to point to when voters ask, why haven’t you made a significant change? So I think that having a more aggressive leader in place who’s more willing to introduce these policies, when they get stuck in the courts, it allows Trump to blame the courts rather than his own administration for getting in his way. He can say, look, I tried, but these judges are blocking me, whereas it wasn’t just the judges blocking him with Secretary Nielsen. It was her, too.michael barbaroIf Congress is not going to change the law, and I think the assumption is that they are not going to do that anytime soon when it comes to basic immigration law, is the president right to suggest that the current system is broken, and the only way to fix it is to test these new ideas, even if they push the boundaries of the law?caitlin dickersonI would say yes to the first part of your question. Most people agree that the system is broken. But when it comes to fixing the problem, what are you trying to fix? In the president’s mind, the problem is the vast number of people coming here to seek asylum. His idea of a fix would decrease that number. But other people see the problem as not that people are coming here to seek asylum at all but the ways that we’re dealing with them. We don’t have space to place people physically in custody when they enter. We don’t have judges to hear their cases for years and years. So if you see that as the problem, then —michael barbaroHe’s not really addressing those.caitlin dickersonHe’s not addressing those problems, and I think that’s because a lot of people who agree with the president are concerned that if we come up with better systems for processing asylum seekers — we make it more organized and efficient and, in some cases, comfortable — that all that will do is encourage more and more people to come. And again, if the numbers themselves are what you see as the problem, then making the system better only makes it worse.michael barbaroCaitlin, what does all of this tell us about where President Trump plans to go on immigration?caitlin dickersonI think it shows that President Trump is going to continue full steam ahead to achieve his immigration goals and that if there are people, even informed career officials, who want to stand in the way of that, they’re going to be pushed out, because he’s very committed to the goal of limiting the number of people who come to the border, regardless of the many legal challenges he’s already faced, those that are sure to come, the public reaction, all these other things notwithstanding. We’re not seeing any signs of slowing down. I think this week is actually an indicator of a ramping up of these goals.michael barbaroIn other words, the gloves are coming off, even though, in a lot of people’s minds, they thought the gloves were already off.caitlin dickersonThat’s right. It’s like another set of gloves are coming off.michael barbaroCaitlin, thank you very much.caitlin dickersonThank you.michael barbaroOn Monday, The Times reported that President Trump plans to push out more officials from the Department of Homeland Security, including the department’s general counsel and the director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, as he seeks to carry out his harder-line approach to immigration. A few hours later, in the latest legal setback to that approach, a federal judge blocked a Trump administration policy that required those seeking asylum to wait in Mexico rather than in the U.S. while their cases made their way through U.S. immigration court. The judge found that the policy violated federal law. Here’s what else you need to know today.archived recording (mike pompeo)Today, the United States is continuing to build its maximum pressure campaign against the Iranian regime. I am announcing our intent to designate the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, including its Quds Force, as a foreign terrorist organization in accordance with Section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act.michael barbaroOn Monday, the Trump administration said that it was designating a powerful arm of the Iranian military as a foreign terrorist organization, the first time that the U.S. has classified part of any country’s government as such a threat.archived recording (mike pompeo)We’re doing it because the Iranian regime’s use of terrorism as a tool of statecraft makes it fundamentally different from any other government.michael barbaroThe move was debated at the highest levels of the administration, with top officials at the Defense Department and the C.I.A. opposing the designation, arguing it could justify Iranian attacks against the U.S. and its allies. But the president’s national security adviser, John Bolton, and his secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, advocated for the decision, arguing the designation would further isolate Iran by discouraging businesses from working with its military.archived recording (mike pompeo)This historic step will deprive the world’s leading state sponsor of terror the financial means to spread misery and death around the world.michael barbaroIn response, Iran’s government said it was designating the U.S. Central Command, which oversees military operations in the Middle East, as a terrorist organization as well. That’s it for “The Daily.” I’m Michael Barbaro. See you tomorrow.The move comes just two days after Mr. Trump, who has repeatedly expressed anger at a rise in migrants at the southwestern border, withdrew his nominee to run Immigration and Customs Enforcement because he wanted the agency to go in a “tougher” direction.Mr. Trump has ratcheted up his anti-immigration message in recent months as he seeks to galvanize supporters before the 2020 election, shutting down the government and then declaring a national emergency to secure funding to build a border wall, cutting aid to Central American countries and repeatedly denouncing what he believes is a crisis of migrants trying to enter the country.He took aim again Sunday night after announcing Ms. Nielsen’s departure, tweeting, “Our Country is FULL!”Ms. Nielsen said she planned “to stay on as secretary through Wednesday” in order “to assist with an orderly transition.” The abruptness was unusual because the Department of Homeland Security currently does not have a deputy secretary, who would normally take the reins.The president said in a tweet that Kevin McAleenan, the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, would take over as the acting replacement for Ms. Nielsen, who became the sixth secretary to lead the agency in late 2017. But by law, the under secretary for management, Claire Grady, who is currently serving as acting deputy secretary, is next in line to be acting secretary. The White House will have to fire her to make Mr. McAleenan acting secretary, people familiar with the transition said. Ms. Grady has told colleagues that she has no intention of resigning to make way for Mr. McAleenan.[Read about Kevin McAleenan, the new acting homeland security secretary.]Among the possible replacements for Ms. Nielsen in the long term is Ken Cuccinelli, the former Virginia attorney general who is a favorite among conservative activists and who fits the profile that Mr. Trump wants the next homeland secretary to have, people familiar with the discussions said.Ms. Nielsen had been pressured by Mr. Trump to be more aggressive in stemming the influx of migrant crossings at the border, people familiar with their discussions in recent months said.Her entire time in the job was spent batting back suspicion from the president, even as he told people he liked how she performed on television and enjoyed dealing with her personally. He initially was skeptical because of Ms. Nielsen’s previous service in the George W. Bush administration, and then because she was close to John F. Kelly, Mr. Trump’s former chief of staff.In her letter resigning as secretary of homeland security, Kirstjen Nielsen wrote: “We have taken unprecedented action to protect Americans. We have implemented historic efforts to defend our borders, combat illegal immigration, obstruct the inflow of drugs, and uphold our laws and values.”The president called Ms. Nielsen at home early in the mornings to demand that she take action to stop migrants from entering the country, including doing things that were clearly illegal, such as blocking all migrants from seeking asylum. She repeatedly noted the limitations imposed on her department by federal laws, court settlements and international obligations.Those responses only infuriated Mr. Trump further. The president’s fury erupted in the spring of 2018 as Ms. Nielsen hesitated for weeks about whether to sign a memo ordering the routine separation of migrant children from their families so that the parents could be detained.In a cabinet meeting surrounded by her peers, Mr. Trump castigated her repeatedly, leading her to draft a resignation letter and to tell colleagues that there was no reason for her to lead the department any longer. By the end of the week, she had reconsidered and remained in her position, becoming an increasingly fierce supporter of his policies, including the family separations.Mr. Trump and Stephen Miller, the president’s top immigration adviser, have privately but regularly complained about Ms. Nielsen. Lou Dobbs, a Fox News host who is one of the president’s favorite sounding boards, has also encouraged Mr. Trump’s negative views of her handling of the migrant crisis.Ms. Nielsen lost a powerful protector when Mr. Kelly, her mentor, left his job as White House chief of staff at the beginning of the year. Mr. Kelly was the Trump administration’s first homeland security secretary and lobbied for Ms. Nielsen to replace him.Multiple White House officials said she had grown deeply paranoid in recent months, after numerous stories about her job being on the line. She also had supported the Immigration and Customs Enforcement nominee Mr. Trump withdrew, Ronald D. Vitiello, and her support for him was described as problematic for her with the president. Mr. Trump felt Mr. Vitiello did not favor closing the border, as the president threatened again to do in a tweet on Sunday night.Since President Trump’s inauguration, White House staffers and cabinet officials have left in firings and resignations, one after the other.In early 2019, as the number of migrant families from Central American countries surged, the president’s fury at Ms. Nielsen did, too. He repeatedly demanded that she cut off foreign aid to Central American countries even though the funding was the responsibility of the State Department. She repeatedly deflected his demands.One day after Ms. Nielsen traveled to Honduras to sign a regional compact with officials from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, Mr. Trump cut State Department funding for the countries. And in recent days, the president made public moves to undercut her authority, leaking news that he might nominate an “immigration czar” to assume oversight of the issue at the heart of Ms. Nielsen’s department.Still, Ms. Nielsen embraced the president’s “crisis” language as apprehensions of migrants at the border shot up to thousands per day. On Friday, Mr. Trump traveled with Ms. Nielsen and Mr. McAleenan to Calexico, Calif., to highlight the issue.While the number of border crossings is not as high as in the early 2000s, the demographic of migrants has shifted largely from individual Mexicans looking for jobs — who could easily be deported — to Central American families, overwhelming detention facilities and prompting mass releases of migrants into cities along the border.Ms. Nielsen estimated last month that border officials had stopped as many as 100,000 migrants in March.But despite the trip and several stories about how much better her relationship with Mr. Trump was, Ms. Nielsen never learned how to manage him, people familiar with their discussions said. He often felt lectured to by Ms. Nielsen, the people familiar with the discussions said.And his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, was not an admirer of Ms. Nielsen, several administration officials said. That came to a head recently as Mr. Kushner had inserted himself into immigration discussions.While Mr. Trump often blamed Ms. Nielsen for the surge in migrant crossings, she will be remembered for leading the department during the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy along the southwestern border, which initially resulted in the separation of thousands of migrant children from their families.An intense backlash ensued, and the Department of Homeland Security was unprepared to deal with separating nearly 3,000 children from their parents.“Hampered by misstep after misstep, Kirstjen Nielsen’s tenure at the Department of Homeland Security was a disaster from the start,” said Representative Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat and the chairman of the House’s committee on Homeland Security. “It is clearer now than ever that the Trump administration’s border security and immigration policies — that she enacted and helped craft — have been an abysmal failure and have helped create the humanitarian crisis at the border.”Mr. Trump eventually moved to halt the family separations, though the government struggled in some cases to reunite those it had already separated.By naming Mr. McAleenan acting secretary, Mr. Trump is installing another veteran of previous administrations, not a loyal foot soldier of Mr. Trump’s campaign.Married to a Salvadoran immigrant, Mr. McAleenan is a lawyer who wrote an honors thesis at Amherst College on marriage equality and applied at the F.B.I. after the Sept. 11 attacks.Described by colleagues as a savvy political operator, Mr. McAleenan worked cooperatively with Obama administration officials but later embraced Mr. Trump’s agenda, which included unshackling Border Patrol agents from restrictions that the previous administration had imposed.Mr. McAleenan was also one of three Department of Homeland Security officials who had urged Ms. Nielsen to sign the memo authorizing the routine separation of migrant families at the border.The department, which has a budget of more than $40 billion and more than 240,000 employees, is an amalgam of 22 government agencies that was created after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. It is responsible for everything from protecting the nation from cyberattacks to responding to natural disasters.At 46, Ms. Nielsen was the youngest person to lead the sprawling department, and an unlikely choice for the job.In the months immediately after the Sept. 11 attacks, she helped set up the Transportation Security Administration, now an agency within the department. She also worked as a special assistant to President George W. Bush on natural disaster response while serving on the White House Homeland Security Council.When Mr. Trump moved Mr. Kelly to the White House in July 2017, Ms. Nielsen moved with him. As the principal deputy chief of staff, she enforced Mr. Kelly’s attempts to regulate access to Mr. Trump in the Oval Office, including the president’s schedule — irritating White House staff members, who complained she was uncompromising.Mr. Kelly later backed Ms. Nielsen to succeed him at the Homeland Security Department, though she was criticized as too inexperienced for the job by Democrats and anti-immigration groups. Mr. Trump, however, said she was “ready on Day 1.”“There will be no on-the-job training for Kirstjen,” Mr. Trump said in October 2017, announcing her nomination for the post.But by the following spring, Ms. Nielsen was telling associates she was miserable in the job.Maggie Haberman reported from New York, and Michael D.
